## QUICK STATUS BY ISSUE

### ✅ RESOLVED (1 issue)

**PVUGC-005: Context Binding**
- v3.0 enhancement (epoch_nonce) FULLY implemented
- Lines 52, 66, 67, 87 in v2.7 spec
- Provable context uniqueness under ROM
- Ready for production mainnet

### ⚠️ PARTIAL (5 issues)

**PVUGC-001: GT-XPDH Assumption (CRITICAL)**
- Documentation enhanced via gap-remediation
- BLOCKER: Zero external cryptanalysis
- Timeline: 3-6 months for production readiness
- Testnet ready NOW, mainnet BLOCKED

**PVUGC-003: Independence Property (CRITICAL)**
- Architectural improvement (transparent CRS)
- BLOCKER: No formal proof or cryptographic enforcement
- Needs: Formal proof OR M2 ceremony OR computational verification
- NOT production-ready without validation

**PVUGC-008: MuSig2 Compartmentalization (HIGH)**
- Operational defense (CSPRNG + blacklist)
- Gap: Reintroduces RNG failure risks
- Needs: Mandatory mixing, deterministic profile option
- Conditionally acceptable with 3 modifications

**PVUGC-007: Timing Attacks (MEDIUM)**
- Strong normative language ("MUST be constant-time")
- Gap: Algorithmic ambiguity (fixed pairing loop unspecified)
- Needs: Fixed-iteration GS-PPE spec, TOST testing
- Conditionally acceptable with implementation hardening

**PVUGC-006: Degenerate Values (MEDIUM)**
- All 7 first-order guards maintained (excellent)
- Gap: Second-order collusive randomness (linked to PVUGC-011)
- First-order security deployment-ready
- Second-order hardening recommended

### ❌ PERSISTS (1 issue)

**PVUGC-011: Collusive Randomness Cancellation (MEDIUM)**
- Unaddressed in v2.7
- v3.0 recommendation: commit-reveal protocol for ρ_i values
- Impact: Coalition grinding attacks, protocol brittleness
- Gap type: Type 5 (Implementation Guidance) - HOW to enforce independence unspecified

---

## PRODUCTION READINESS BY DEPLOYMENT TIER

### Tier 1: Testnet - ✅ READY NOW

**Verdict:** Approved for immediate testnet deployment

**Rationale:**
- All Stage 1 mitigations present (no regressions)
- First-order security properties maintained
- Transparent CRS architecture validated
- epoch_nonce enhancement adopted
- Suitable for developer testing and experimentation

**No blockers**

---

### Tier 2: Limited Production - ⚠️ CONDITIONAL (2-4 weeks)

**Verdict:** Conditionally approved with mandatory modifications

**Required Modifications:**
1. **MUST implement PVUGC-011 commit-reveal** (1-2 weeks)
   - 3-phase protocol for ρ_i values
   - Eliminates collusive randomness attacks

2. **MUST upgrade PVUGC-008 mixing to MUST** (1 week)
   - Change line 113: SHOULD → MUST
   - Add deterministic profile option
   - Strengthen blacklist specification

3. **MUST specify PVUGC-007 fixed pairing loop** (1 week)
   - Add normative §12.2.1
   - Specify exactly 96 pairings (no data-dependent branches)
   - Add TOST testing methodology

4. **SHOULD implement Multi-CRS defense** (2 weeks)
   - Restore MUST for critical deployments
   - Mitigates single hash function weakness

**After conditions met:**
- Suitable for controlled deployments
- Acceptable for low-value transactions
- Acceptable for early adopters
- Risk: Critical assumptions (GT-XPDH, Independence) unproven but mitigated

**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks

---

### Tier 3: Mainnet Production - 🔴 BLOCKED (3-6 months)

**Verdict:** NOT production-ready - critical work required

**Blockers:**

**BLOCKER 1: GT-XPDH External Cryptanalysis (PVUGC-001) - CRITICAL**
- Status: Zero external validation of novel assumption
- Required: Academic cryptanalysis by ≥2 independent teams
- Deliverable: Published cryptanalysis (conference paper or eprint)
- Timeline: 3-6 months
- Priority: CRITICAL (single point of failure for protocol security)

**BLOCKER 2: Independence Property Validation (PVUGC-003) - CRITICAL**
- Status: No formal proof or cryptographic enforcement
- Required: ONE of:
  - Option A: Formal proof (3-4 months)
  - Option B: M2's statistical independence ceremony (2-3 months)
  - Option C: Runtime computational verification (1-2 months)
- Timeline: 2-4 months (depends on approach)
- Priority: CRITICAL (adaptive x attack not prevented)

**BLOCKER 3: All Tier 2 Conditions**
- Must meet all limited production requirements

**After blockers resolved:**
- Suitable for high-value transactions
- Acceptable for critical infrastructure
- Formal validation of foundational assumptions complete

**Timeline:** 3-6 months minimum

## SUMMARY ASSESSMENT

### Major Achievements

1. **No Regressions:** All v2.0 mitigations maintained in v2.7
2. **PVUGC-005 Success:** Context binding fully resolved (epoch_nonce implemented)
3. **PVUGC-010 Resolution:** Research-remediation workflow successfully closed specification gaps
4. **Architectural Progress:** Transparent CRS approach validated (PVUGC-010, PVUGC-003)

### Critical Gaps

1. **GT-XPDH (PVUGC-001):** Novel assumption lacks external cryptanalysis - MAINNET BLOCKER
2. **Independence (PVUGC-003):** No formal proof or cryptographic enforcement - MAINNET BLOCKER
3. **Collusive Randomness (PVUGC-011):** Commit-reveal protocol not implemented - LIMITED PRODUCTION BLOCKER

### Partial Progress

1. **MuSig2 (PVUGC-008):** Operational defense in place, needs deterministic profile for critical infrastructure
2. **Timing Attacks (PVUGC-007):** Strong normative language, needs algorithmic specificity
3. **Degenerate Values (PVUGC-006):** First-order excellent, second-order linked to PVUGC-011
