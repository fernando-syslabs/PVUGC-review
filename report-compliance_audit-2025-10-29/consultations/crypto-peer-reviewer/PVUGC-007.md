# PVUGC-007 Crypto-Peer-Reviewer Assessment

**Date:** 2025-10-28 23:25
**Expert:** Crypto-Peer-Reviewer
**Issue:** PVUGC-007 (Timing Attacks & Race Conditions)
**Consultation Request:** Standards compliance validation - side-channel security and liveness assessment

---

**Vote:** **PARTIAL**

---

## Reasoning

The v2.7 specification demonstrates **substantial progress** in addressing timing side-channel and liveness concerns identified in the v3.0 peer review, but falls short of providing **algorithmically enforceable constant-time guarantees** and **verifiable compliance criteria** that are essential for cryptographic protocols claiming zero-knowledge properties. While the normative language is present ("MUST be constant-time"), the specification lacks the **algorithmic precision** needed to make this requirement **testable and implementable** without ambiguity.

### Side-Channel Prevention Analysis

**Assessment:** **Improvement but insufficient algorithmic enforcement**

v2.7 contains **three explicit MUST requirements** for constant-time execution:
1. Line 377: "Decap, pairings, scalars, and DEM MUST be constant-time"
2. Line 374: "constant‑time decap (no early returns; verify all equations then branch on result)"
3. Line 306: "constant‑time pairings, constant‑time DEM decryption"

**Strengths:**
- **Normative language:** The use of MUST (RFC 2119) elevates constant-time from recommendation to requirement
- **No early returns:** Line 374 explicitly forbids early abort patterns, addressing a common timing leak vector
- **Cache-timing awareness:** Line 377 mentions "avoid cache-tunable table leakage" - rare to see in protocol specs
- **Library guidance:** Line 390 recommends libraries with "constant-time pairings and explicit subgroup checks"

**Critical Gap: Algorithmic Under-Specification**

The phrase "constant-time decap" is **semantically ambiguous** without algorithmic specification:

**Problem 1: Variable Loop Iteration Count**

M2's v3.0 analysis quantified that decapsulation loops over `m₁ + m₂` pairings, where `m₁, m₂ ∈ [1, 96]` and `m₁ + m₂ ≤ 96`. If the implementation naively loops over the **actual** commitment count:

```rust
// VULNERABLE: Loop count varies with m₁, m₂
for j in 0..m1 {
    product *= pairing(C1[j], D1[j]);  // Constant-time per pairing
}
for k in 0..m2 {
    product *= pairing(D2[k], C2[k]);  // Constant-time per pairing
}
```

This leaks `m₁ + m₂` via **total execution time** even if each individual pairing is constant-time. With μs-level timing precision (achievable via `rdtsc` or network observation), an adversary distinguishes:
- Min case: m₁=1, m₂=1 → 2 pairings → ~2.4ms
- Max case: m₁=48, m₂=48 → 96 pairings → ~115.2ms
- **Distinguishability:** 112.8ms difference is trivially observable

M2's information-theoretic analysis showed this leaks **I(W; T_decap) ≈ 10-12 bits** on average, with **complete witness structure leakage** (H=0) for extreme small witnesses.

**v2.7's "constant-time decap" does NOT prevent this** unless interpreted to mean "fixed iteration count", which requires **algorithmic specification**:

```rust
// CORRECT: Fixed 96 iterations regardless of m₁, m₂
const MAX_PAIRINGS: usize = 96;
for i in 0..MAX_PAIRINGS {
    if i < m1 {
        product *= pairing(C1[i], D1[i]);
    } else {
        product *= pairing(G1::identity(), G2::identity());  // Dummy pairing
    }
}
// Similar for m₂ commitments
```

M2's v3.0 recommendation explicitly specified: **"MUST perform fixed 96 pairing operations regardless of actual m₁, m₂"** with **"Pad with dummy pairings e(G₁_identity, G₂_identity)"**. This is **algorithmic enforcement**, not just normative guidance.

**Problem 2: DEM Decryption Early Abort**

Line 374 states "no early returns; verify all equations then branch on result" for decapsulation, but does NOT explicitly address DEM tag verification. A naive implementation might:

```rust
// VULNERABLE: Early abort on tag mismatch
let plaintext = poseidon2_decrypt(ct, K);
if !verify_tag(tag, K, ct, AD) {
    return Err("Invalid tag");  // Timing leak: fail-fast path is faster
}
```

The success path (tag valid) vs. failure path (tag invalid) have **measurably different timing** (typically 1-5μs difference for hash-based MACs). Over many observations, this leaks which armers provided valid vs. malformed ciphertexts.

**Correct implementation** (implied by "verify all equations then branch on result"):
```rust
// CORRECT: Constant-time tag verification
let plaintext = poseidon2_decrypt(ct, K);
let tag_valid = constant_time_eq(tag, compute_tag(K, ct, AD));
// Use constant-time select to return plaintext OR dummy
constant_time_select(tag_valid, plaintext, DUMMY)
```

This is **implementation technique**, not **specification**. v2.7 hints at it ("no early returns") but doesn't mandate the constant-time selection pattern.

**Cryptographic Verdict on Side-Channels:**

The **zero-knowledge property** M2 identified as violated requires:
```
For all witnesses w, w' and all adversaries A with timing oracle:
  | Pr[A(w, Time(Decap(w))) = 1] - Pr[A(w', Time(Decap(w'))) = 1] | < negl(λ)
```

v2.7's text **implies** this via "MUST be constant-time", but does NOT **algorithmically enforce** it. Two independent implementers could both claim "constant-time" compliance while producing:
- Implementation A: Fixed 96 pairings (M2 spec) → **ZK preserved**
- Implementation B: Variable m₁+m₂ pairings with constant-time library → **ZK violated**

Both satisfy v2.7's text ("constant-time pairings") but only A prevents the information leak.

**Assessment:** v2.7 provides **normative intent** but lacks **algorithmic precision**. This is a **HIGH severity gap** because zero-knowledge is a **core security property**, not an optimization.

---

### Testing and Verification Analysis

**Assessment:** **Critical verifiability gap**

v2.7 specifies **MUST requirements** without **acceptance criteria**. How does an auditor verify that an implementation satisfies "MUST be constant-time"?

**Standard Practice in Cryptographic Specifications:**

Cryptographic standards typically provide **test vectors** and **validation methodology**:

- **FIPS 140-3 (NIST):** Requires statistical randomness tests (ENT, Dieharder) with pass/fail thresholds
- **RFC 9380 (Hash-to-Curve):** Provides 150+ test vectors covering edge cases
- **BIP-340 (Schnorr):** Provides test vectors and reference implementation for interoperability

For **constant-time requirements**, the state-of-the-art is:

**1. TOST (Two One-Sided Tests) for Equivalence:**

M2's v3.0 recommendation (correcting the statistically incorrect Welch's t-test in earlier drafts):
```
Test null hypothesis H₀: Timing distributions differ by more than ε
Accept H₁ (constant-time) if BOTH one-sided tests reject at α=0.05 level
Requires n ≥ 10⁶ samples per distribution
```

This is **standard methodology** in side-channel resistance validation (see: Bernstein's "Cache-timing attacks on AES", Langley's "ctgrind", Project Wycheproof).

**2. Representative Test Cases:**

M2 specified:
```
Test 1: (m₁=20, m₂=20) vs (m₁=48, m₂=48) - Min vs Max pairing counts
Test 2: Valid DEM tag vs Invalid DEM tag - Success vs Failure paths
Test 3: All k PoCE-B valid vs 1 invalid - Early-abort detection
```

These are **security-critical edge cases** where timing leaks are most likely.

**v2.7's Position:**

**Zero testing requirements specified.** Line 377 says "MUST be constant-time" but provides:
- No test vectors
- No statistical testing methodology
- No acceptance thresholds (what is "constant-time"? ±1μs? ±1ms?)
- No CI/CD integration guidance

**Consequence:**

Without test methodology, "MUST be constant-time" is **unverifiable**. Implementations can claim compliance with:
- No statistical validation
- No independent audit
- No interoperability assurance

This is **acceptable** for non-cryptographic requirements (e.g., "SHOULD log errors"), but **unacceptable** for a requirement protecting a **core cryptographic property** (zero-knowledge).

**Comparison: Other Gaps in v2.7 with Testing**

Interestingly, v2.7 DOES provide testing guidance for other requirements:
- Line 191: GS size bound (m₁+m₂≤96) - **Algorithmically testable** (reject if sum exceeds 96)
- Line 374: Subgroup checks - **Testable** (verify point is in prime-order subgroup)
- Line 306: Canonical encodings - **Testable** (reject non-canonical representations)

Why does **constant-time** lack similar precision?

**Cryptographic Verdict on Testing:**

The absence of **statistical testing requirements** and **test vectors** for constant-time compliance is a **CRITICAL gap** because:
1. **Unverifiable:** Auditors cannot assess compliance objectively
2. **Uninteroperable:** No ground truth for what "constant-time" means quantitatively
3. **Unreproducible:** Different implementations will have different (unstated) tolerance levels

This is **specification immaturity**, not acceptable implementation discretion.

---

### Liveness and State Machine Analysis

**Assessment:** **Acceptable timeout-based approach with minor gaps**

**Strengths:**

v2.7 provides **two layers** of liveness protection:

**Layer 1: CSV Timeout Path (Line 315)**
```
Timeout/Abort path (MUST for production). CSV=Δ path (e.g., Δ=144 blocks ≈24h)
sending funds to a neutral sink or alternate policy. Required to prevent indefinite
liveness failure if any armer posts malformed masks/ciphertexts that pass PoK but
fail PoCE-B at decap time.
```

This is **excellent**:
- **MUST for production** (upgraded from v2.0's SHOULD)
- **Rationale provided:** "prevent indefinite liveness failure"
- **Concrete parameter:** Δ=144 blocks (industry-standard Bitcoin timeout)
- **Operator-agnostic:** "This is operator-agnostic liveness protection, not optional"

The phrase **"not optional"** is particularly strong - it signals that CSV path is **mandatory for production deployments**, even though the core WE innovation is path-agnostic.

**Layer 2: Per-Phase Timeouts (Line 375)**
```
enforce per-phase timeouts (arming: 120s, presig: 180s); abort on timeout or mismatch
```

This prevents **intra-protocol deadlock** (armers waiting indefinitely for each other), while CSV handles **inter-protocol deadlock** (Bitcoin-level fund recovery).

**Comparison to M2's State Machine:**

M2 proposed a **formal state machine** with 8 states (IDLE, ARMING, PRE_SIGNING, AWAITING_PROOF, DECAP, BROADCAST, COMPLETED, ABORTED) and **transition invariants**:
```
Invariant I1: Once ARMING completes, pre-signature cannot be used for different (vk,x)
Invariant I2: CSV timeout Δ_CSV > T_ARMING + T_PRESIG + T_PROVING
Invariant I3: Timeout transitions are irreversible (ABORTED is terminal)
Invariant I4: At most one adaptor (T, R, s') per context
```

**Trade-off Analysis:**

| Approach | Precision | Implementability | Testability |
|----------|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| **M2 Formal State Machine** | High (8 states, 4 invariants, explicit transition logic) | Low (requires state tracking, event handlers) | High (can verify state transitions) |
| **v2.7 Timeout-Based** | Medium (3 timeout values, CSV path) | High (simpler: just enforce timeouts) | Medium (can verify timeouts, but state implicit) |

**Cryptographic Verdict on Liveness:**

v2.7's **timeout-based approach is acceptable** for liveness protection:
- **CSV path (MUST):** Prevents indefinite fund lockup ✅
- **Per-phase timeouts:** Prevents coordinator deadlock ✅
- **Missing formal states:** Not a security gap, just lower precision

The **missing formal state machine** is a **MEDIUM severity gap**:
- **Workaround exists:** Implementers can derive state machine from timeout logic
- **Risk manageable:** Timeout values (120s, 180s, 144 blocks) are concrete enough
- **Best practice missing:** Formal states improve auditability and testing

**Minor Gap: State Transition Invariants**

M2's invariants (I1-I4) enforce **cryptographic binding** between protocol phases:
- **I1:** Prevents arming reuse across contexts (security-critical for ctx_hash binding)
- **I4:** One adaptor per context (prevents nonce reuse in MuSig2)

v2.7 **implies** these via ctx_hash binding and "fresh T, fresh R" (line 306), but does NOT state them as **explicit invariants**. This is a **LOW severity gap** (implied by other requirements).

---

### Cache-Timing and Library Validation

**Assessment:** **Adequate awareness, weak validation**

**Strengths:**

Line 377 is **unusually sophisticated** for a protocol specification:
```
avoid cache-tunable table leakage across different `ctx_hash` values
```

This shows **awareness** of:
- **Cache-timing attacks:** Flush+Reload, Prime+Probe, Evict+Time
- **Data-dependent table lookups:** Pairing libraries use precomputed tables indexed by scalar bits
- **Cross-context leakage:** Attackers observing cache state across multiple decapsulations with different ctx_hash

This level of detail is **rare** in protocol specs (most just say "use constant-time crypto" with no cache awareness).

**Library Guidance (Line 390):**
```
choose libraries with constant‑time pairings and explicit subgroup checks
```

This is **actionable guidance** but lacks **validation methodology**.

**Gaps:**

M2 recommended **cache-timing testing**:
- Flush+Reload simulation (measure cache eviction patterns)
- Prime+Probe simulation (measure cache set contention)
- Performance counter monitoring (Intel PT, ARM PMU)

v2.7 **mentions** cache-timing risks but provides **no testing methodology**. This is a **MEDIUM severity gap**:
- **Workaround:** Rely on library documentation (e.g., blst's constant-time guarantees)
- **Risk:** Implementers may choose libraries without validating cache resistance
- **Best practice:** Provide recommended libraries with validation evidence

**Recommended Library Validation (Not in v2.7):**

M2 specified:
```
Recommended Libraries:
- blst (Rust/C): Constant-time by default, battle-tested
- arkworks (Rust): Enable `asm` and `constant_time` features
- MCL (C++): Use `MCL_USE_CONSTANT_TIME` flag
```

v2.7 **lacks** this actionable guidance. Implementers may choose libraries like:
- **PBC (Pairing-Based Cryptography):** Fast but NOT constant-time by default
- **RELIC:** Configurable, but constant-time features are opt-in

**Verdict:** Cache-timing awareness is present, but **validation gap** prevents verification.

---

### Production Readiness Determination

**Overall Assessment:** **Conditionally acceptable with mandatory hardening**

v2.7 represents **substantial improvement** from v2.0 (which had only generic "consider constant-time" language), but falls short of **cryptographic-grade specification** due to:

**CRITICAL Gaps (Must Fix Before Production):**
1. **Algorithmic constant-time specification:** Add fixed 96 pairing loop with padding
2. **Statistical testing methodology:** Add TOST requirements with test vectors

**HIGH Gaps (Should Fix, Workarounds Exist):**
3. **DEM constant-time tag verification:** Explicitly require constant-time MAC verification
4. **PoCE-B constant-time verification:** Require verifying all k shares without early abort

**MEDIUM Gaps (Recommended Improvement):**
5. **Formal state machine:** Add explicit states and invariants (improves auditability)
6. **Cache-timing testing:** Add Flush+Reload, Prime+Probe test guidance
7. **Library validation:** Provide recommended libraries with validation evidence

**LOW Gaps (Optional Enhancement):**
8. **Front-running mitigations:** Add §12.3 with encrypted mempool guidance

**Security Posture:**

Given M2's quantified **10-12 bit witness leakage per observation** (worst-case: complete leakage), v2.7's current text:
- **Prevents exploitation IF** implementers interpret "constant-time decap" as "fixed 96 pairings" (optimistic interpretation)
- **Permits exploitation IF** implementers interpret "constant-time decap" as "use constant-time pairing library" while keeping variable loop count (literal interpretation)

The **ambiguity** is the problem. Cryptographic specifications must be **unambiguous** to prevent vulnerabilities.

**Conditional Acceptance Criteria:**

v2.7 is **production-ready IF AND ONLY IF** implementations adopt:
1. **Fixed 96 pairing loop** (algorithmic constant-time)
2. **TOST validation** with ≥10⁶ samples, ε < 2^-40
3. **Constant-time DEM tag verification** (no early abort)
4. **Cache-resistant pairing library** (blst, arkworks with constant_time feature)

These are **not optional** - they are **mandatory to preserve zero-knowledge**.

---

## Evidence from PVUGC-2025-10-27.md

**Supporting v2.7's Improvement:**

1. **Line 377 (MUST constant-time):**
   > "Decap, pairings, scalars, and DEM MUST be constant-time; no data-dependent branches; avoid cache-tunable table leakage across different `ctx_hash` values."

   **Assessment:** Strongest normative language for side-channel protection in any PVUGC version

2. **Line 374 (No early returns):**
   > "constant‑time decap (no early returns; verify all equations then branch on result)"

   **Assessment:** Prevents common timing leak pattern (fail-fast early abort)

3. **Line 315 (CSV MUST for production):**
   > "Timeout/Abort path (MUST for production). ... Required to prevent indefinite liveness failure ... This is operator-agnostic liveness protection, not optional."

   **Assessment:** Excellent - CSV upgraded from SHOULD to MUST, strong rationale

4. **Line 375 (Per-phase timeouts):**
   > "enforce per-phase timeouts (arming: 120s, presig: 180s); abort on timeout or mismatch"

   **Assessment:** Concrete timeout values prevent coordinator deadlock

**Illustrating v2.7's Gaps:**

1. **No algorithmic specification for fixed pairing count**
   - Search: "96 pairing" → Found only in Line 191 (size bound), NOT in decapsulation algorithm
   - M2's "MUST perform fixed 96 pairing operations" → **Absent**

2. **No statistical testing requirements**
   - Search: "TOST", "statistical", "equivalence test", "timing test" → **No matches**
   - M2's TOST methodology, test vectors, CI/CD integration → **Absent**

3. **No formal state machine**
   - Search: "state machine", "IDLE", "ARMING", "PRE_SIGNING" → **No matches** (only timeout values)
   - M2's 8-state machine with invariants → **Absent**

4. **No front-running mitigation**
   - Search: "front-running", "encrypted mempool", "direct miner" → **No matches**
   - M2's §12.3 guidance → **Absent**

---

## Gap Classification

| Gap | Severity | Rationale |
|-----|----------|-----------|
| **Fixed 96 pairing loop specification** | **CRITICAL** | Absence allows variable-time implementations that leak 10-12 bits per observation, **violating zero-knowledge property**. Two implementers can both claim "constant-time" compliance with different algorithms (fixed vs. variable count). **Algorithmic ambiguity** in cryptographic specifications is a **specification failure**. |
| **Statistical testing methodology (TOST)** | **CRITICAL** | "MUST be constant-time" is **unverifiable** without test methodology. Implementations cannot prove compliance, auditors cannot validate claims. This is **specification immaturity** - cryptographic requirements need **acceptance criteria**. |
| **DEM constant-time tag verification** | **HIGH** | v2.7 implies this ("no early returns") but does NOT explicitly require constant-time MAC verification. Fail-fast tag checks leak 1-5μs, revealing which armers provided malformed ciphertexts over many observations. **Workaround:** Implementers familiar with constant-time crypto will do this correctly, but spec should be explicit. |
| **PoCE-B constant-time verification** | **HIGH** | No requirement to verify all k armer shares without early abort. Early abort on first invalid share leaks **which armer** is malicious via timing. For threshold settings with large k, this is **correlation attack** enabler. **Workaround:** Implementers can infer from general constant-time guidance. |
| **Formal state machine** | **MEDIUM** | Timeout values (120s, 180s, CSV Δ) provide liveness protection, but lack **explicit state definitions and invariants** reduces auditability. Implementers can derive state machine from timeouts, but formal states improve testing. **Workaround:** Derive implicit state machine from timeout logic. |
| **Cache-timing testing** | **MEDIUM** | v2.7 mentions "avoid cache-tunable table leakage" but provides no **validation methodology** (Flush+Reload, Prime+Probe tests). Implementers relying on library claims (e.g., "blst is constant-time") have no **independent validation**. **Workaround:** Trust library documentation. |
| **Library validation guidance** | **MEDIUM** | No recommended libraries (blst, arkworks, MCL) with feature flags (constant_time, asm). Implementers may choose PBC or RELIC without enabling constant-time modes. **Workaround:** Cryptography-aware implementers will choose correct libraries. |
| **Front-running mitigation** | **LOW** | No guidance on encrypted mempool or direct miner submission. Front-running window exists between proof submission and broadcast. **Workaround:** Operational countermeasures (submit to private mempool, use Flashbots-like services). Not a **protocol-level** issue. |

## Recommended Actions

### CRITICAL (MUST Fix Before Production)

**1. Add Algorithmic Constant-Time Specification**

Insert into Line 374 (KEM/DEM section):

```markdown
**Constant-time decapsulation (MUST):** Implementations MUST execute a fixed number
of pairing operations regardless of the actual GS attestation size (m₁, m₂):

1. Compute product initialization: product = 1_GT
2. FOR i = 0 TO 95:
   - IF i < m₁: product *= e(C¹ᵢ, D₁,ᵢ)
   - ELSE: product *= e(G₁_identity, D₁,₀)  // Dummy pairing
3. FOR j = 0 TO 95:
   - IF j < m₂: product *= e(D₂,ⱼ, C²ⱼ)
   - ELSE: product *= e(G₁_identity, D₂,₀)  // Dummy pairing
4. Compare product ?= R(vk,x)^ρ AFTER all 96 pairings complete

This ensures total execution time is independent of witness structure, preserving
the zero-knowledge property. Implementations MUST NOT use variable-length loops
based on m₁, m₂ values, as this leaks approximately log₂(m₁·m₂/96) bits of witness
structure information per decapsulation.
```

**Rationale:** Removes algorithmic ambiguity, makes zero-knowledge property **verifiable**.

---

**2. Add Statistical Testing Requirements**

Insert new subsection after Line 377:

```markdown
**Constant-time validation (MUST for production deployments):**

Implementations claiming constant-time compliance MUST provide statistical validation
evidence using Two One-Sided Tests (TOST) for equivalence:

**Test 1: Decapsulation Timing Uniformity**
- Inputs: Attestations with (m₁=10, m₂=10), (m₁=48, m₂=48), (m₁=1, m₁=1)
- Samples: n ≥ 10⁶ timing measurements per input
- Method: TOST with equivalence bounds ε = 2^(-20) for CI/CD, ε = 2^(-40) for production
- Pass criteria: Both one-sided tests reject at α=0.05 significance level

**Test 2: DEM Decryption Tag Verification**
- Inputs: Valid ciphertext (correct tag), Invalid ciphertext (incorrect tag)
- Samples: n ≥ 10⁶ timing measurements per input
- Method: TOST with equivalence bounds ε = 2^(-60) (cryptographic-grade)
- Pass criteria: Both one-sided tests reject at α=0.05 significance level

**Test 3: PoCE-B Verification**
- Inputs: All k shares valid, One share invalid (rest valid)
- Samples: n ≥ 10⁵ timing measurements per input
- Method: TOST with equivalence bounds ε = 2^(-40)
- Pass criteria: Both one-sided tests reject at α=0.05 significance level

**CI/CD Integration:** Timing tests SHOULD be integrated into continuous integration
pipelines and MUST fail builds if equivalence is rejected (timing leak detected).

**Reference Implementation:** Provide reference implementation with TOST validation
demonstrating compliant constant-time execution across all test cases.
```

**Rationale:** Makes "MUST be constant-time" **testable and verifiable**, aligns with FIPS 140-3 validation methodology.

---

### HIGH (SHOULD Fix, Workarounds Exist)

**3. Explicitly Require Constant-Time DEM Tag Verification**

Modify Line 374 to add:

```markdown
DEM decryption MUST use constant-time tag verification: compute MAC for both success
and failure cases, use constant-time comparison (e.g., `subtle::ConstantTimeEq` in Rust),
and constant-time selection to return plaintext on success or dummy value on failure.
Implementations MUST NOT use early-abort patterns (e.g., `if !verify_tag() { return Err }`).
```

**Rationale:** Eliminates 1-5μs timing difference between valid/invalid tag paths.

---

**4. Explicitly Require Constant-Time PoCE-B Verification**

Modify Line 375 to add:

```markdown
PoCE-B verification MUST check all k armer shares in constant-time: verify each share's
pairing equation Tᵢ ?= sᵢ·G regardless of earlier failures, accumulate results in a bitmask,
and report validation outcome only after all k shares are checked. Implementations MUST NOT
use early-abort on first invalid share.
```

**Rationale:** Prevents correlation attacks that identify malicious armers via timing.

---

### MEDIUM (Recommended Improvement)

**5. Add Formal State Machine (Optional but Recommended)**

Insert new section §12.2 State Machine:

```markdown
### 12.2 Protocol State Machine (Recommended)

Implementations SHOULD maintain explicit protocol state to enforce phase transitions
and timeout invariants:

**States:**
- IDLE: Pre-initialization
- ARMING: Collecting armer shares (timeout: 120s from first share)
- PRE_SIGNING: MuSig2 adaptor signature generation (timeout: 180s from arming complete)
- AWAITING_PROOF: Waiting for valid GS attestation (timeout: CSV Δ blocks)
- DECAP: Decapsulation in progress (atomic operation)
- BROADCAST: Transaction broadcast to Bitcoin network
- COMPLETED: Terminal success state
- ABORTED: Terminal failure state (CSV recovery active)

**Invariants:**
- I1: ctx_hash is immutable after ARMING state entry
- I2: Adaptor (T, R, s') cannot be reused across different ctx_hash
- I3: CSV timeout Δ_CSV > T_ARMING + T_PRESIG (120s + 180s = 300s = 50 blocks minimum)
- I4: ABORTED state is terminal (no transition back to active states)
```

**Rationale:** Improves auditability and testing, prevents state confusion bugs.

---

**6. Add Cache-Timing Testing Guidance**

Modify Line 377 to add:

```markdown
**Cache-timing validation (SHOULD):** Implementations SHOULD validate cache resistance
using:
- Flush+Reload simulation (measure cache eviction patterns during decapsulation)
- Prime+Probe simulation (measure cache set contention across different ctx_hash)
- Performance counter monitoring (Intel PT, ARM PMU) to detect data-dependent cache access

Recommended tool: ctgrind (constant-time validation tool by Adam Langley)
```

**Rationale:** Provides actionable validation methodology for cache-timing claims.

---

**7. Add Library Validation Guidance**

Modify Line 390 to add:

```markdown
**Recommended pairing libraries with validated constant-time properties:**
- blst (Rust/C): Constant-time by default, used by Ethereum, extensive audit history
- arkworks (Rust): Enable `asm` and `constant_time` features for constant-time execution
- MCL (C++): Use `MCL_USE_CONSTANT_TIME` compilation flag

Implementations MUST document:
1. Which pairing library is used
2. Library version and commit hash
3. Feature flags enabled (if any)
4. Cache-timing validation evidence (if available)

Avoid libraries without explicit constant-time guarantees (e.g., PBC without modifications,
RELIC without CONSTTIME configuration).
```

**Rationale:** Prevents implementers from choosing libraries with unknown or poor constant-time properties.

---

### LOW (Optional Enhancement)

**8. Add Front-Running Mitigation Guidance**

Insert new section §12.3 Front-Running Mitigations (optional):

```markdown
### 12.3 Front-Running Mitigations (Optional)

After decapsulation but before Bitcoin network broadcast, a front-running window exists
where an observer with mempool access can extract (s, R) from the broadcast transaction
and attempt to front-run with higher fees.

**Mitigation strategies (SHOULD consider for high-value contracts):**
- **Encrypted mempool:** Submit to services providing encrypted relay (e.g., Flashbots Protect)
- **Direct miner submission:** Submit directly to mining pool APIs (bypasses public mempool)
- **Commit-reveal:** Split transaction into commit (reveal s' in OP_RETURN) and reveal
  (publish s in second transaction) with time lock

Note: This is an **operational concern**, not a protocol-level vulnerability. The Bitcoin
network's first-seen policy and CPFP anchor provide baseline protection.
```

**Rationale:** Provides guidance on known attack vector without overspecifying operational details.

---

## Summary

**Vote: PARTIAL**

v2.7 demonstrates **substantial progress** in addressing M2's v3.0 timing and liveness concerns, with strong normative language ("MUST be constant-time") and upgraded liveness protection (CSV "MUST for production"). However, **critical specification gaps** remain:

1. **Algorithmic ambiguity:** "Constant-time decap" permits variable-loop implementations that leak 10-12 bits per observation
2. **Verifiability gap:** No statistical testing methodology makes "MUST" claims unverifiable

These gaps are **CRITICAL** because they:
- Undermine the **zero-knowledge property** (core security claim)
- Prevent **independent validation** (no objective compliance assessment)
- Allow **non-interoperable interpretations** (fixed vs. variable pairing counts)

**Conditional Acceptance:**

v2.7 is **production-ready IF** implementations adopt:
1. Fixed 96 pairing loop (algorithmic constant-time)
2. TOST validation with ε < 2^-40
3. Constant-time DEM/PoCE-B verification
4. Cache-resistant libraries (blst, arkworks with features)

**Recommendation:** Adopt **Critical** and **High** recommended actions to upgrade v2.7 from **PARTIAL (conditionally acceptable)** to **RESOLVED (unconditionally production-ready)**.
