# PVUGC-007: Timing Attacks & Race Conditions - Standards Validation

**Date:** 2025-10-28 23:30
**Original Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Enhanced (Medium Severity - v3.0 Peer Review 2025-10-26)
**Validation Result:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL**
**Decision Method:** üîê Crypto-Peer-Reviewer Consultation

---

## Executive Summary

**Verdict:** v2.7 demonstrates **substantial progress** in addressing timing side-channel and liveness vulnerabilities identified in the v3.0 peer review, with strong normative language ("MUST be constant-time") and upgraded liveness protection (CSV "MUST for production"). However, **critical specification gaps** remain that prevent full resolution:

1. **Algorithmic Ambiguity (CRITICAL):** The phrase "constant-time decap" does not specify **fixed 96 pairing operations with padding**, allowing implementers to use variable-loop-count algorithms that leak 10-12 bits of witness structure per observation, **violating the zero-knowledge property**.

2. **Verifiability Gap (CRITICAL):** No statistical testing methodology (TOST) provided, making "MUST be constant-time" claims **unverifiable** by independent auditors or CI/CD pipelines.

3. **CSV Timeout Upgrade (EXCELLENT):** Timeout/Abort path upgraded from v2.0's SHOULD to **"MUST for production"** with strong rationale, preventing indefinite liveness failure.

4. **Per-Phase Timeouts (GOOD):** Concrete timeout values (arming: 120s, presig: 180s) prevent coordinator deadlock.

**Impact:** The zero-knowledge property‚Äîa **core cryptographic guarantee** of the protocol‚Äîremains **conditionally vulnerable** due to algorithmic under-specification. Two independent implementers can both claim "constant-time" compliance while producing:
- Implementation A: Fixed 96 pairings (M2's v3.0 spec) ‚Üí **ZK preserved** ‚úÖ
- Implementation B: Variable m‚ÇÅ+m‚ÇÇ pairings with constant-time library ‚Üí **ZK violated** ‚ùå (10-12 bit leak)

Both satisfy v2.7's text but have **different security properties**.

**Production Readiness:** **Conditionally acceptable** IF implementations adopt:
1. Fixed 96 pairing loop (algorithmic constant-time)
2. TOST validation with Œµ < 2^-40
3. Constant-time DEM/PoCE-B verification
4. Cache-resistant pairing libraries (blst, arkworks with features)

Without these **mandatory implementation hardening** measures, v2.7 permits zero-knowledge violations.

## Original Security Concern (v3.0 Peer Review - 2025-10-26)

### Issue Description

**Source:** `report-peer_review-2025-10-26/PVUGC-007.md`
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Enhanced (Medium severity, though debate occurred about upgrading to High)
**Severity Rationale:** Timing side-channel **violates zero-knowledge property** (not just implementation concern) + liveness deadlock enables trivial DoS attacks.

**M2's Key Findings:**

**1. Timing Side-Channel Quantification (Critical Finding)**

M2 formalized timing leakage using mutual information framework:

```
I(W; T_decap) ‚âà log‚ÇÇ(m‚ÇÅm‚ÇÇ/96) bits

Average-case leakage: 10-12 bits per observation (with Œºs-level timing precision)
Worst-case leakage: Complete witness structure (H=0) for extreme small witnesses (m‚ÇÅ=1, m‚ÇÇ=1)
Multi-observation attack: O(11) timing measurements to extract full 128-bit witness
```

**Mechanism:** GS-PPE decapsulation loops over m‚ÇÅ + m‚ÇÇ pairings, where m‚ÇÅ, m‚ÇÇ ‚àà [1, 96] and m‚ÇÅ + m‚ÇÇ ‚â§ 96. Total execution time varies:
- Min case: m‚ÇÅ=1, m‚ÇÇ=1 ‚Üí 2 pairings ‚Üí ~2.4ms
- Max case: m‚ÇÅ=48, m‚ÇÇ=48 ‚Üí 96 pairings ‚Üí ~115.2ms
- **Distinguishability:** 112.8ms difference is trivially observable with Œºs-level timing

**Security Implication:** **Violates zero-knowledge property** by revealing witness structure through timing.

**2. Liveness Deadlock (Critical Finding)**

**Scenario:** k-1 armers publish valid shares, k-th armer never publishes ‚Üí protocol deadlocks indefinitely without timeout.

**Impact:** Trivial DoS attack vector. Funds locked without recovery mechanism.

**3. Front-Running Window (Medium Finding)**

**Scenario:** After decapsulation but before Bitcoin broadcast, mempool observer extracts (s, R) and front-runs with higher fees.

**Impact:** Permissionless decappers can be front-run, but CPFP anchor provides baseline defense.

### M2's Priority Recommendations

**Recommendation 1: ¬ß12.1 Constant-Time Execution (MUST)**

**Key Requirements:**
- **Fixed 96 pairing operations** regardless of actual m‚ÇÅ, m‚ÇÇ (pad with dummy pairings e(G‚ÇÅ_id, G‚ÇÇ_id))
- **Constant-time DEM decryption** (no early abort on tag mismatch)
- **Statistical testing via TOST methodology** (NOT Welch's t-test which is statistically incorrect)
- **Cache-timing resistance** (constant-time pairing libraries with validated cache resistance)

**Algorithmic Specification Example:**
```rust
const MAX_PAIRINGS: usize = 96;
for i in 0..MAX_PAIRINGS {
    if i < m1 {
        product *= pairing(C1[i], D1[i]);
    } else {
        product *= pairing(G1::identity(), G2::identity());  // Dummy
    }
}
```

**Testing Requirements (TOST):**
```
Test 1: GS-PPE Decapsulation
- Inputs: (m‚ÇÅ=20, m‚ÇÇ=20) vs (m‚ÇÅ=48, m‚ÇÇ=48)
- Samples: ‚â•10‚Å∂ per input
- Method: TOST with Œµ < 2^-40 for production
- Pass: Both one-sided tests reject at Œ±=0.05

Test 2: DEM Decryption
- Inputs: Valid tag vs Invalid tag
- Samples: ‚â•10‚Å∂ per input
- Method: TOST with Œµ < 2^-60 (cryptographic-grade)
```

---

**Recommendation 2: ¬ß12.2 State Machine with Timeouts (MUST)**

**Formal States:**
```
IDLE ‚Üí ARMING ‚Üí PRE_SIGNING ‚Üí AWAITING_PROOF ‚Üí DECAP ‚Üí BROADCAST ‚Üí COMPLETED/ABORTED
```

**Timeouts:**
- T_ARMING = 24 hours (all k armers must publish)
- T_PRESIG = 1 hour (MuSig2 completion)
- T_PROVING = 10 minutes (proof submission after presig) ‚Üí Covered by CSV Œî
- T_BROADCAST = 5 minutes (transaction broadcast after decap)

**Invariants:**
- I1: ctx_hash is immutable after ARMING
- I2: Adaptor (T, R, s') cannot be reused across different ctx_hash
- I3: CSV timeout Œî > T_ARMING + T_PRESIG
- I4: ABORTED state is terminal (no transition back)

---

**Recommendation 3: ¬ß12.3 Front-Running Mitigations (SHOULD)**

**Strategies:**
- Encrypted mempool (Flashbots Protect)
- Direct miner submission (bypass public mempool)
- Commit-reveal schemes

**Note:** Operational concern, not protocol-level vulnerability.

**Relevant Sections Found:**

### Section 1: Side-Channel Protection (Line 377 - ¬ß12 Engineering Checklist)

**Location:** PVUGC-2025-10-27.md, Line 377

**Evidence:**
```markdown
* **Side-channel protection:** Decap, pairings, scalars, and DEM MUST be constant-time;
  no data-dependent branches; avoid cache-tunable table leakage across different
  `ctx_hash` values.
```

**Analysis:**
- ‚úÖ **MUST requirement** (RFC 2119 normative language)
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive scope:** Decap, pairings, scalars, DEM
- ‚úÖ **No data-dependent branches** (prevents common timing leak pattern)
- ‚úÖ **Cache-timing awareness:** "avoid cache-tunable table leakage" (unusually sophisticated for protocol spec)
- ‚ùå **No algorithmic specification:** Does NOT specify "fixed 96 pairing operations with padding"
- ‚ùå **No testing methodology:** No TOST requirements, test vectors, or CI/CD integration

---

### Section 2: KEM/DEM Constant-Time Requirements (Line 374 - ¬ß12 Engineering Checklist)

**Location:** PVUGC-2025-10-27.md, Line 374

**Evidence:**
```markdown
* **KEM/DEM:** constant‚Äëtime decap (no early returns; verify all equations then branch
  on result); subgroup checks (verify $R(\mathsf{vk},x) \neq 1$, prime-order only);
  $\rho_i\neq 0$; canonical $\mathrm{ser}_{\mathbb{G}_T}$ (fixed-length 576 bytes =
  12√ó48B Fp limbs, little-endian for BLS12-381); GS size limit ($m_1 + m_2 \leq 96$);
  nonce‚Äëfree, key‚Äëcommitting DEM (Poseidon2); reject non‚Äëcanonical encodings.
```

**Analysis:**
- ‚úÖ **"No early returns"** - Prevents fail-fast timing leaks
- ‚úÖ **"Verify all equations then branch on result"** - Implies deferred error handling
- ‚úÖ **GS size limit (m‚ÇÅ + m‚ÇÇ ‚â§ 96)** - DoS prevention
- ‚ùå **Algorithmic ambiguity:** "Constant-time decap" does NOT specify:
  - Fixed loop iteration count (96 pairings)
  - Padding mechanism (dummy pairings for m‚ÇÅ+m‚ÇÇ < 96)
  - Whether "verify all equations" means "compute all 96 pairings" or "compute m‚ÇÅ+m‚ÇÇ pairings in constant-time"

**Critical Gap Illustration:**

Two interpretations of "constant-time decap":

**Interpretation A (M2's intent - ZK-preserving):**
```rust
// Fixed 96 pairings ALWAYS
for i in 0..96 {
    if i < m1 + m2 { /* actual pairing */ }
    else { /* dummy pairing */ }
}
// Execution time: Always ~115ms (96 pairings)
```

**Interpretation B (Literal reading - ZK-violating):**
```rust
// Variable count but constant-time per pairing
for i in 0..(m1 + m2) {  // Loop count varies!
    pairing(C[i], D[i]);  // Each pairing is constant-time
}
// Execution time: 2.4ms to 115ms depending on m1+m2
// Leaks: 10-12 bits of witness structure
```

Both satisfy v2.7's text ("constant-time pairings", "no early returns"), but only A preserves zero-knowledge.

### Section 3: Mandatory Hygiene (Line 306 - ¬ß8 Product-Key KEM)

**Location:** PVUGC-2025-10-27.md, Line 306

**Evidence:**
```markdown
**Mandatory hygiene:** subgroup checks ($\mathbb{G}_1$, $\mathbb{G}_2$, $\mathbb{G}_T$),
cofactor clearing, constant‚Äëtime pairings, constant‚Äëtime DEM decryption, strict encodings
(reject non‚Äëcanonical), strict BIP‚Äë340 canonical encodings for $R$ and $s$ (reject
non‚Äëcanonical signatures), rejection sampling for derived scalars, fresh $\rho_i$,
fresh $T$, fresh MuSig2 $R$.
```

**Analysis:**
- ‚úÖ **Constant-time pairings** (explicit requirement)
- ‚úÖ **Constant-time DEM decryption** (explicit requirement)
- ‚ùå **No testing methodology** (how to verify compliance?)
- ‚ùå **No PoCE-B constant-time requirement** (verify all k shares without early abort)

---

### Section 4: Library Guidance (Line 390 - ¬ß13 Minimal Example)

**Location:** PVUGC-2025-10-27.md, Line 390

**Evidence:**
```markdown
**Curve note.** For concreteness, implementers may target an asymmetric Type‚Äë3 pairing
(e.g., a BLS12 family). The spec is agnostic; choose libraries with constant‚Äëtime
pairings and explicit subgroup checks.
```

**Analysis:**
- ‚úÖ **Library guidance:** "choose libraries with constant-time pairings"
- ‚ùå **No recommended libraries:** Does NOT specify blst, arkworks, MCL
- ‚ùå **No feature flags:** Does NOT mention `constant_time` features in arkworks
- ‚ùå **No validation methodology:** Does NOT mention cache-timing tests (Flush+Reload, Prime+Probe)

---

### Section 5: Timeout/Abort Path (Line 315 - ¬ß9 Activation Patterns)

**Location:** PVUGC-2025-10-27.md, Line 315

**Evidence:**
```markdown
* **Timeout/Abort path (MUST for production).** `CSV=Œî` path (e.g., Œî=144 blocks ‚âà24h)
  sending funds to a neutral sink or alternate policy. Required to prevent indefinite
  liveness failure if any armer posts malformed masks/ciphertexts that pass PoK but fail
  PoCE-B at decap time. This is operator-agnostic liveness protection, not optional.
```

**Analysis:**
- ‚úÖ **Upgraded from SHOULD to MUST** (v2.0 had "SHOULD enable Timeout/Abort")
- ‚úÖ **Strong rationale:** "Required to prevent indefinite liveness failure"
- ‚úÖ **Concrete parameter:** Œî=144 blocks (industry-standard Bitcoin timeout)
- ‚úÖ **Emphatic language:** "not optional" reinforces MUST requirement
- ‚úÖ **Operator-agnostic liveness protection** (clear security property)

**Verdict:** **EXCELLENT** - This is a major improvement from v2.0 and addresses M2's deadlock concern at the Bitcoin script level.

---

### Section 6: Per-Phase Timeouts (Line 375 - ¬ß12 Engineering Checklist)

**Location:** PVUGC-2025-10-27.md, Line 375

**Evidence:**
```markdown
* **k‚Äëof‚Äëk arming:** verify all PoK + PoCE + ciphertexts before pre‚Äësign; check per-share
  $T_i \neq \mathcal{O}$ and aggregated $T \neq \mathcal{O}$; enforce per-phase timeouts
  (arming: 120s, presig: 180s); abort on timeout or mismatch.
```

**Analysis:**
- ‚úÖ **Per-phase timeouts:** arming (120s), presig (180s)
- ‚úÖ **Concrete values:** Not generic "add timeouts" - specific durations
- ‚úÖ **Abort on timeout:** Clear failure handling
- ‚ùå **No formal state machine:** Does NOT define states (IDLE, ARMING, PRE_SIGNING, etc.)
- ‚ùå **No state invariants:** Does NOT specify I1-I4 from M2's recommendation
- ‚ùå **No CSV coordination:** Does NOT state relationship Œî_CSV > T_ARMING + T_PRESIG

**Verdict:** **GOOD** - Timeout values provide liveness protection, but lack formal state machine reduces auditability.

---

### Section 7: GS Attestation Size Bounds (Line 191 - ¬ß5 GS Attestation)

**Location:** PVUGC-2025-10-27.md, Line 191

**Evidence:**
```markdown
**GS attestation size bounds (MUST - DoS prevention):** Implementations MUST reject GS
attestations where the total number of pairings exceeds 96. Specifically, if $m_1$ is
the number of G‚ÇÅ commitments and $m_2$ is the number of G‚ÇÇ commitments, then MUST
enforce: $m_1 + m_2 \leq 96$. This prevents denial-of-service attacks via oversized
attestations while allowing typical Groth16‚ÜíGS encodings (20-40 pairings). For
BLS12-381, 96 pairings requires ~50-100ms verification time on modern hardware -
acceptable for one-time decapsulation.
```

**Analysis:**
- ‚úÖ **MUST requirement** with rationale (DoS prevention)
- ‚úÖ **Precise bound:** m‚ÇÅ + m‚ÇÇ ‚â§ 96
- ‚úÖ **Performance note:** ~50-100ms for 96 pairings (sets expectation)
- ‚ùå **Does NOT mandate fixed 96 pairings:** Only an upper bound, not a fixed count

**Note:** This is a **size limit** (reject if > 96), NOT a **constant-time specification** (always compute 96).

## Standards Framework Application

**Applicable Framework Sections:**

### RFC 2119 (Normative Language)

**Standard:** MUST/SHOULD/MAY keywords have precise meanings
**v2.7 Compliance:** ‚úÖ **PASS**
- Correct use of MUST for constant-time requirements (lines 306, 374, 377)
- Correct use of MUST for CSV timeout (line 315)
- Correct use of SHOULD in appropriate contexts

---

### NIST SP 800-90B (Entropy and Randomness)

**Standard:** Statistical testing for cryptographic implementations
**v2.7 Compliance:** ‚ùå **FAIL**
- No statistical testing requirements for constant-time claims
- M2's TOST methodology (correct statistical approach) is absent
- "MUST be constant-time" is unverifiable without test methodology

---

### FIPS 140-3 (Cryptographic Module Validation)

**Standard:** Side-channel resistance validation methodology
**v2.7 Compliance:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL**
- Constant-time requirements present (lines 306, 374, 377)
- Cache-timing awareness present (line 377)
- **Gap:** No validation methodology (TOST tests, cache-timing tests)
- **Gap:** No test vectors for constant-time verification

**Note:** FIPS 140-3 requires **demonstrated compliance** via validated test suites, not just normative text.

---

### RFC 8937 (Randomness Improvements for Security Protocols)

**Standard:** Timing attack prevention in cryptographic protocols
**v2.7 Compliance:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL**
- Acknowledges timing attacks (line 377)
- Requires constant-time operations (lines 306, 374, 377)
- **Gap:** No algorithmic specification (fixed iteration count)
- **Gap:** No guidance on implementation techniques (constant-time selection, masking)

**Best Practice:** RFC 8937 ¬ß4.2 recommends "fixed execution time" with specific algorithmic patterns, not just "use constant-time crypto".

---

### Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs)

**BIP-340 (Schnorr Signatures):**
- ‚úÖ Test vectors provided (14 test cases)
- ‚úÖ Reference implementation provided (Python)
- ‚ùå v2.7 lacks similar rigor for constant-time requirements

**BIP-327 (MuSig2):**
- ‚úÖ Nonce generation guidance (deterministic with session binding)
- ‚úÖ Test vectors for key aggregation
- ‚ùå v2.7's MuSig2 guidance (line 372) lacks test vectors

## Expert Consultation

**Expert:** Crypto-Peer-Reviewer (Side-Channel Security Specialist)
**Consultation File:** `.consultation-pvugc-007-crypto-response.md`
**Vote:** **PARTIAL**
**Date:** 2025-10-28 23:25

### Expert Assessment Summary

**Vote Reasoning (Key Points):**

1. **Substantial Progress Acknowledged:**
   - Strong normative language ("MUST be constant-time")
   - CSV timeout upgraded from SHOULD to MUST (excellent)
   - Cache-timing awareness rare in protocol specs

2. **Critical Algorithmic Ambiguity:**
   - "Constant-time decap" permits two interpretations:
     - **A:** Fixed 96 pairings (ZK-preserving) ‚úÖ
     - **B:** Variable m‚ÇÅ+m‚ÇÇ pairings with constant-time library (ZK-violating) ‚ùå
   - Both satisfy v2.7's text but only A prevents 10-12 bit leak
   - **Problem:** Cryptographic specifications must be **unambiguous**

3. **Critical Verifiability Gap:**
   - "MUST be constant-time" is **unverifiable** without TOST methodology
   - No test vectors, no sample size requirements, no equivalence bounds
   - Contrast: BIP-340 provides 14 test vectors, reference implementation

4. **Liveness Protection Adequate:**
   - CSV path (MUST) + per-phase timeouts (120s, 180s) prevent deadlock
   - Missing formal state machine is **MEDIUM severity** (workaround exists)

5. **Cache-Timing Awareness vs. Validation:**
   - v2.7 mentions "avoid cache-tunable table leakage" (sophisticated)
   - No validation methodology (Flush+Reload, Prime+Probe tests)
   - **MEDIUM severity gap** (can rely on library documentation)

### Expert Gap Classification

| Gap | Severity | Expert Rationale |
|-----|----------|------------------|
| **Fixed 96 pairing loop specification** | **CRITICAL** | Absence allows variable-time implementations that leak 10-12 bits per observation, **violating zero-knowledge property**. Algorithmic ambiguity in cryptographic specs is a **specification failure**. |
| **Statistical testing methodology (TOST)** | **CRITICAL** | "MUST be constant-time" is **unverifiable** without test methodology. Implementations cannot prove compliance, auditors cannot validate claims. **Specification immaturity**. |
| **DEM constant-time tag verification** | **HIGH** | v2.7 implies this ("no early returns") but does NOT explicitly require constant-time MAC verification. Fail-fast tag checks leak 1-5Œºs. **Workaround:** Implementers familiar with constant-time crypto will do this correctly. |
| **PoCE-B constant-time verification** | **HIGH** | No requirement to verify all k armer shares without early abort. Early abort leaks **which armer** is malicious via timing. **Workaround:** Implementers can infer from general constant-time guidance. |
| **Formal state machine** | **MEDIUM** | Timeout values provide liveness protection, but lack explicit states/invariants reduces auditability. **Workaround:** Derive implicit state machine from timeout logic. |
| **Cache-timing testing** | **MEDIUM** | Mentions "avoid cache leakage" but no validation methodology. **Workaround:** Trust library documentation (blst, arkworks). |
| **Library validation guidance** | **MEDIUM** | No recommended libraries with feature flags. Implementers may choose PBC/RELIC without constant-time modes. **Workaround:** Cryptography-aware implementers will choose correctly. |
| **Front-running mitigation** | **LOW** | No encrypted mempool/direct miner guidance. **Workaround:** Operational countermeasures. Not protocol-level issue. |

### Expert Recommendations (Summary)

**CRITICAL (MUST Fix Before Production):**
1. Add algorithmic constant-time specification (fixed 96 pairing loop with padding)
2. Add statistical testing requirements (TOST with Œµ < 2^-40, test vectors)

**HIGH (SHOULD Fix, Workarounds Exist):**
3. Explicitly require constant-time DEM tag verification
4. Explicitly require constant-time PoCE-B verification (all k shares)

**MEDIUM (Recommended Improvement):**
5. Add formal state machine (states, invariants)
6. Add cache-timing testing guidance (Flush+Reload, Prime+Probe)
7. Add library validation guidance (blst, arkworks, MCL with feature flags)

**LOW (Optional Enhancement):**
8. Add front-running mitigation guidance (¬ß12.3)

## Final Determination

**Result:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL**

**Lead Auditor Reasoning:**

I concur with the crypto-peer-reviewer's PARTIAL assessment. v2.7 demonstrates **substantial improvement** from v2.0 and addresses many of M2's v3.0 concerns, but **critical specification gaps** prevent full resolution:

### What v2.7 Gets Right

1. **Strong Normative Language:**
   - "MUST be constant-time" appears 3 times (lines 306, 374, 377)
   - "No early returns" prevents common timing leak
   - "Avoid cache-tunable table leakage" shows sophisticated awareness

2. **Excellent Liveness Protection:**
   - CSV timeout upgraded from SHOULD (v2.0) to **MUST for production** (v2.7)
   - Strong rationale: "required to prevent indefinite liveness failure"
   - Per-phase timeouts (120s, 180s) concrete and actionable
   - Emphatic language: "not optional"

3. **Comprehensive Scope:**
   - Covers decapsulation, pairings, scalars, DEM (holistic approach)
   - Addresses cache-timing (rare in protocol specs)
   - Library guidance (line 390)

### Critical Gaps That Prevent Full Resolution

**Gap 1: Algorithmic Ambiguity (CRITICAL)**

The phrase "constant-time decap" is **semantically ambiguous** without algorithmic specification:

**Problem:** Two interpretations exist:
- **Optimistic:** Fixed 96 pairings (M2's intent) ‚Üí ZK preserved ‚úÖ
- **Literal:** Variable m‚ÇÅ+m‚ÇÇ pairings with constant-time library ‚Üí ZK violated ‚ùå (10-12 bit leak)

Both satisfy v2.7's text ("constant-time pairings", "no early returns").

**Why This Matters:** M2's v3.0 analysis quantified:
- **Average-case leakage:** 10-12 bits per observation (Œºs-level timing precision achievable)
- **Worst-case leakage:** Complete witness structure (H=0) for m‚ÇÅ=1, m‚ÇÇ=1
- **Multi-observation attack:** O(11) timing measurements to extract full 128-bit witness

The **zero-knowledge property** is a **core cryptographic guarantee** of PVUGC. Permitting implementations that leak 10-12 bits per observation **violates this core property**.

**Cryptographic Standards Requirement:** Specifications must be **unambiguous** to prevent vulnerabilities. Compare:
- **BIP-340 (Schnorr):** Algorithmic specification with pseudocode
- **RFC 9380 (Hash-to-Curve):** Step-by-step algorithms with test vectors
- **v2.7 (Constant-Time):** "MUST be constant-time" without algorithm

**Verdict:** This is a **CRITICAL specification gap** because it undermines a **core security property**.

---

**Gap 2: Verifiability Gap (CRITICAL)**

"MUST be constant-time" without testing methodology is **unverifiable**:

**Problem:** How does an auditor verify compliance?
- No test vectors (compare: BIP-340 has 14 test cases)
- No statistical methodology (TOST with Œµ thresholds)
- No sample size requirements (n ‚â• 10‚Å∂)
- No CI/CD integration guidance

**Consequence:** Implementations can claim compliance with:
- No statistical validation
- No independent audit
- No interoperability assurance

**Standards Precedent:**
- **FIPS 140-3:** Requires validated test suites for side-channel resistance claims
- **NIST SP 800-90B:** Statistical testing for entropy/randomness claims
- **BIP-340:** Test vectors for Schnorr signature verification

**Verdict:** This is a **CRITICAL specification gap** because cryptographic requirements need **acceptance criteria**, not just normative text.

---

**Gap 3: Missing Formal State Machine (MEDIUM)**

v2.7 provides timeout values (120s, 180s, CSV Œî) but no formal states/invariants:

**Trade-off Analysis:**
- **Precision:** M2's state machine has 8 states, 4 invariants (high precision)
- **Implementability:** v2.7's timeout-based approach is simpler (easier to implement)
- **Testability:** Formal states improve auditability, timeout values are concrete enough

**Verdict:** Timeout-based approach is **acceptable** for liveness, but formal state machine is **best practice**. This is a **MEDIUM severity gap** (workaround exists: derive implicit state machine from timeouts).

---

### Conditional Acceptance Criteria

v2.7 is **production-ready IF AND ONLY IF** implementations adopt:

**Mandatory Implementation Hardening:**
1. **Fixed 96 pairing loop** (algorithmic constant-time, not just library constant-time)
2. **TOST validation** with ‚â•10‚Å∂ samples, Œµ < 2^-40
3. **Constant-time DEM tag verification** (no early abort on MAC failure)
4. **Constant-time PoCE-B verification** (verify all k shares, deferred error reporting)
5. **Cache-resistant pairing library** (blst, or arkworks with `constant_time` feature)

These are **NOT optional** - they are **mandatory to preserve zero-knowledge**.

**Problem:** v2.7 does not make #1-4 **algorithmically explicit**, relying on implementer interpretation. This is **specification immaturity** for a cryptographic protocol.

---

## Acceptance Criteria for Full Resolution

To upgrade from ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL to ‚úÖ RESOLVED, v2.7 must address:

### CRITICAL Requirements (Blockers)

**1. Algorithmic Constant-Time Specification**

Add to Line 374 (or new ¬ß12.1):

```markdown
**Constant-time decapsulation (MUST):** Implementations MUST execute exactly 96 pairing
operations regardless of the actual GS attestation size (m‚ÇÅ, m‚ÇÇ):

Algorithm:
1. Initialize: product = 1_GT
2. FOR i = 0 TO 95:
   - IF i < m‚ÇÅ: product *= e(C¬π·µ¢, D‚ÇÅ,·µ¢)
   - ELSE: product *= e(G‚ÇÅ_identity, D‚ÇÅ,‚ÇÄ)  // Dummy pairing
3. FOR j = 0 TO 95:
   - IF j < m‚ÇÇ: product *= e(D‚ÇÇ,‚±º, C¬≤‚±º)
   - ELSE: product *= e(G‚ÇÅ_identity, D‚ÇÇ,‚ÇÄ)  // Dummy pairing
4. Verify: product ?= R(vk,x)^œÅ AFTER all 96 pairings complete

Rationale: Ensures total execution time is independent of witness structure (m‚ÇÅ, m‚ÇÇ),
preserving the zero-knowledge property. Variable-length loops leak log‚ÇÇ(m‚ÇÅ¬∑m‚ÇÇ/96) bits.
```

**Acceptance Criterion:** Pseudocode with fixed loop iteration count, dummy pairing specification, rationale for zero-knowledge preservation.

---

**2. Statistical Testing Methodology**

Add new section ¬ß12.2 (or extend ¬ß12):

```markdown
**Constant-time validation (MUST for production):**

Test 1: Decapsulation Timing Uniformity
- Inputs: Attestations (m‚ÇÅ=10,m‚ÇÇ=10), (m‚ÇÅ=48,m‚ÇÇ=48), (m‚ÇÅ=1,m‚ÇÇ=1)
- Samples: n ‚â• 10‚Å∂ timing measurements per input
- Method: TOST with Œµ = 2^(-40) equivalence bounds
- Pass: Both one-sided tests reject at Œ±=0.05

Test 2: DEM Tag Verification
- Inputs: Valid ciphertext, Invalid ciphertext
- Samples: n ‚â• 10‚Å∂ per input
- Method: TOST with Œµ = 2^(-60)
- Pass: Both one-sided tests reject at Œ±=0.05

Test 3: PoCE-B Verification
- Inputs: All k valid shares, One invalid share
- Samples: n ‚â• 10‚Åµ per input
- Method: TOST with Œµ = 2^(-40)
- Pass: Both one-sided tests reject at Œ±=0.05

CI/CD: Timing tests MUST be integrated into CI pipelines, failing builds on timing leaks.
```

**Acceptance Criterion:** TOST methodology specified, test vectors provided, sample sizes given, Œµ thresholds justified, CI/CD integration guidance.

---

### HIGH Requirements (Strongly Recommended)

**3. Explicit Constant-Time DEM Tag Verification**

Modify Line 374:

```markdown
DEM decryption MUST use constant-time tag verification: compute MAC for both success
and failure paths, use constant-time comparison, constant-time selection to return
plaintext (success) or dummy (failure). NO early-abort patterns.
```

**Acceptance Criterion:** Explicit prohibition of early-abort on MAC failure, constant-time selection requirement.

---

**4. Explicit Constant-Time PoCE-B Verification**

Modify Line 375:

```markdown
PoCE-B verification MUST check all k armer shares in constant-time: verify each T·µ¢ ?= s·µ¢¬∑G
regardless of earlier failures, accumulate results in bitmask, report outcome after all
k checks complete. NO early-abort on first invalid share.
```

**Acceptance Criterion:** Explicit requirement to verify all k shares, deferred error reporting, no early-abort.

---

### MEDIUM Requirements (Recommended Improvements)

**5. Formal State Machine (Optional)**

Add ¬ß12.3 State Machine:
- 8 states (IDLE, ARMING, PRE_SIGNING, AWAITING_PROOF, DECAP, BROADCAST, COMPLETED, ABORTED)
- 4 invariants (I1: ctx_hash immutable, I2: adaptor non-reuse, I3: CSV > timeouts, I4: ABORTED terminal)

**Acceptance Criterion:** Formal state definitions, transition conditions, invariants specified.

---

**6. Cache-Timing Testing Guidance**

Add to Line 377:

```markdown
Cache-timing validation SHOULD use Flush+Reload, Prime+Probe simulations, performance
counter monitoring (Intel PT, ARM PMU). Recommended tool: ctgrind.
```

**Acceptance Criterion:** Validation methodology for cache-timing resistance.

---

**7. Library Validation Guidance**

Modify Line 390:

```markdown
Recommended libraries: blst (constant-time by default), arkworks (enable `asm` and
`constant_time` features), MCL (use `MCL_USE_CONSTANT_TIME` flag). Implementations MUST
document library, version, feature flags, cache-timing validation evidence.
```

**Acceptance Criterion:** Recommended libraries, feature flags, documentation requirements.

---

## Gaps

### CRITICAL Gaps (Specification Failures)

**Gap 1: Algorithmic Constant-Time Under-Specification**

**Type:** Type 1 (Algorithm Specification Gap) - Mechanism described ("constant-time decap") but algorithm not specified (fixed 96 pairings with padding)

**Description:** v2.7 states "MUST be constant-time" but does NOT specify:
- Fixed loop iteration count (96 pairings)
- Padding mechanism (dummy pairings for m‚ÇÅ+m‚ÇÇ < 96)
- Whether "constant-time" means library-level or algorithmic-level

**Impact:** Permits implementations with variable execution time that leak 10-12 bits of witness structure per observation, **violating the zero-knowledge property**.

**Reference:** Lines 306, 374, 377 state "constant-time" but lack algorithmic detail (compare: M2's v3.0 ¬ß12.1 specifies "MUST perform fixed 96 pairing operations regardless of actual m‚ÇÅ, m‚ÇÇ")

**Acceptance Criterion:** Add pseudocode specifying fixed 96 pairing loop with dummy padding (see Recommended Action #1 from crypto-peer-reviewer).

---

**Gap 2: Statistical Testing Methodology Absent**

**Type:** Type 3 (Test Vector Gap) + Type 5 (Implementation Guidance Gap) - Algorithm implied but no test vectors or validation methodology

**Description:** v2.7 requires "MUST be constant-time" without:
- TOST (Two One-Sided Tests) methodology
- Test vectors (e.g., (m‚ÇÅ=20,m‚ÇÇ=20) vs (m‚ÇÅ=48,m‚ÇÇ=48))
- Sample size requirements (n ‚â• 10‚Å∂)
- Equivalence bounds (Œµ < 2^-40)
- CI/CD integration guidance

**Impact:** "MUST be constant-time" is **unverifiable** by independent auditors or automated testing. Implementations cannot prove compliance.

**Reference:** Crypto-peer-reviewer assessment: "This is specification immaturity - cryptographic requirements need acceptance criteria."

**Acceptance Criterion:** Add ¬ß12.2 (or extend ¬ß12) with TOST methodology, 3 test cases, sample sizes, Œµ thresholds, CI/CD guidance (see Recommended Action #2).

---

### HIGH Gaps (Missing Explicit Requirements)

**Gap 3: DEM Constant-Time Tag Verification Not Explicit**

**Type:** Type 5 (Implementation Guidance Gap) - What is clear (constant-time DEM) but how to implement securely is unclear

**Description:** Line 374 states "constant-time DEM decryption" and "no early returns", but does NOT explicitly require:
- Constant-time MAC verification (compute MAC in both success/failure paths)
- Constant-time comparison (subtle::ConstantTimeEq or equivalent)
- Constant-time selection (return plaintext or dummy based on constant-time condition)

**Impact:** Implementers may use early-abort patterns (`if !verify_tag() { return Err }`) that leak 1-5Œºs timing difference between valid/invalid tags.

**Workaround:** Experienced constant-time crypto developers will infer correct implementation from "no early returns".

**Acceptance Criterion:** Add explicit requirement for constant-time MAC verification with constant-time selection pattern (see Recommended Action #3).

---

**Gap 4: PoCE-B Constant-Time Verification Not Specified**

**Type:** Type 5 (Implementation Guidance Gap) - Mechanism present (PoCE-B verification) but constant-time requirement unclear

**Description:** Line 375 requires "verify all PoK + PoCE + ciphertexts" but does NOT specify:
- Verify all k armer shares **without early abort** on first failure
- Deferred error reporting (accumulate failures in bitmask, report after all k checks)

**Impact:** Early abort on first invalid PoCE-B share leaks **which armer** is malicious via timing (correlation attack in threshold settings).

**Workaround:** Implementers familiar with constant-time verification patterns will infer this from general "constant-time" guidance.

**Acceptance Criterion:** Add explicit requirement to verify all k shares in constant-time with deferred error reporting (see Recommended Action #4).

---

### MEDIUM Gaps (Best Practice Missing)

**Gap 5: Formal State Machine Absent**

**Type:** Type 5 (Implementation Guidance Gap) - Timeout values present (120s, 180s, CSV Œî) but formal state machine missing

**Description:** v2.7 provides:
- Per-phase timeouts (line 375: arming 120s, presig 180s)
- CSV timeout (line 315: Œî=144 blocks)

But does NOT provide:
- Formal state definitions (IDLE, ARMING, PRE_SIGNING, AWAITING_PROOF, DECAP, BROADCAST, COMPLETED, ABORTED)
- State transition conditions
- Invariants (I1-I4 from M2's v3.0)

**Impact:** Lower auditability (no explicit states to verify), harder to test state transitions. Implementers can derive implicit state machine from timeout logic.

**Workaround:** Timeout values are concrete enough for liveness protection. Implementers can derive state machine.

**Acceptance Criterion:** Add ¬ß12.3 with formal states, transition conditions, invariants (see Recommended Action #5).

---

**Gap 6: Cache-Timing Testing Methodology Absent**

**Type:** Type 5 (Implementation Guidance Gap) - Cache-timing awareness present (line 377) but validation methodology missing

**Description:** v2.7 mentions "avoid cache-tunable table leakage" (sophisticated awareness) but provides:
- No Flush+Reload simulation guidance
- No Prime+Probe simulation guidance
- No performance counter monitoring (Intel PT, ARM PMU)
- No recommended tools (ctgrind)

**Impact:** Implementers relying on library claims ("blst is constant-time") have no independent validation methodology.

**Workaround:** Trust library documentation (blst provides constant-time guarantees, extensively tested).

**Acceptance Criterion:** Add cache-timing testing guidance to line 377 or new ¬ß12.4 (see Recommended Action #6).

---

**Gap 7: Library Validation Guidance Incomplete**

**Type:** Type 5 (Implementation Guidance Gap) - Library guidance present (line 390) but lacks specific recommendations

**Description:** Line 390 says "choose libraries with constant-time pairings" but does NOT specify:
- Recommended libraries (blst, arkworks, MCL)
- Feature flags (arkworks: `asm`, `constant_time`)
- Compilation flags (MCL: `MCL_USE_CONSTANT_TIME`)
- Libraries to avoid (PBC without modifications, RELIC without CONSTTIME config)

**Impact:** Implementers may choose libraries with unknown or poor constant-time properties.

**Workaround:** Cryptography-aware implementers will research and choose appropriate libraries.

**Acceptance Criterion:** Add recommended libraries with feature flags to line 390 (see Recommended Action #7).

---

### LOW Gaps (Optional Enhancements)

**Gap 8: Front-Running Mitigation Guidance Absent**

**Type:** Type 5 (Implementation Guidance Gap) - Operational concern, not protocol-level requirement

**Description:** M2's v3.0 recommended ¬ß12.3 Front-Running Mitigations (SHOULD):
- Encrypted mempool (Flashbots Protect)
- Direct miner submission
- Commit-reveal schemes

v2.7 does not provide this guidance.

**Impact:** Permissionless decappers can be front-run by mempool observers extracting (s, R) and submitting with higher fees. CPFP anchor provides baseline defense.

**Workaround:** Operational countermeasures (private mempool, Flashbots-like services).

**Acceptance Criterion:** Add ¬ß12.4 (or extend ¬ß12) with front-running mitigation strategies (see Recommended Action #8). This is **optional** as it's operational, not protocol-level.

---

## Recommendations

### CRITICAL (MUST Implement for Production)

**Recommendation 1: Add Algorithmic Constant-Time Specification**

**Priority:** CRITICAL (MUST)
**Category:** Specification Amendment

**Action:** Insert pseudocode into Line 374 (or new ¬ß12.1) specifying:
1. Fixed 96 pairing loop (not variable m‚ÇÅ+m‚ÇÇ loop)
2. Dummy pairing mechanism: e(G‚ÇÅ_identity, D‚ÇÅ,‚ÇÄ) for i ‚â• m‚ÇÅ
3. Rationale: Preserves zero-knowledge by preventing log‚ÇÇ(m‚ÇÅ¬∑m‚ÇÇ/96) bit leak

**Rationale:** Removes algorithmic ambiguity that permits ZK-violating implementations. Makes "constant-time" requirement **verifiable** and **unambiguous**.

**Standards Reference:** BIP-340 provides algorithmic pseudocode for Schnorr signature verification. v2.7 should do the same for constant-time decapsulation.

**Acceptance Criterion:** Pseudocode with fixed iteration count, dummy pairing specification, zero-knowledge preservation rationale.

**Detailed Spec Text:** See crypto-peer-reviewer's Recommended Action #1.

---

**Recommendation 2: Add Statistical Testing Requirements**

**Priority:** CRITICAL (MUST)
**Category:** Specification Amendment + Test Vector Generation

**Action:** Add new section ¬ß12.2 (or extend ¬ß12) with:
1. TOST (Two One-Sided Tests) methodology for equivalence testing
2. Three test cases: Decapsulation (m‚ÇÅ=10,m‚ÇÇ=10 vs m‚ÇÅ=48,m‚ÇÇ=48), DEM (valid vs invalid tag), PoCE-B (all valid vs one invalid)
3. Sample size: n ‚â• 10‚Å∂ for decapsulation/DEM, n ‚â• 10‚Åµ for PoCE-B
4. Equivalence bounds: Œµ < 2^-40 for production (GS-PPE, PoCE-B), Œµ < 2^-60 for cryptographic-grade (DEM)
5. CI/CD integration: Fail builds if TOST rejects equivalence

**Rationale:** Makes "MUST be constant-time" **verifiable** by providing objective acceptance criteria. Aligns with FIPS 140-3 validation methodology.

**Standards Reference:**
- NIST SP 800-90B: Statistical testing for cryptographic implementations
- FIPS 140-3: Side-channel resistance validation
- BIP-340: Provides 14 test vectors for Schnorr signatures

**Acceptance Criterion:** TOST methodology documented, test vectors provided, sample sizes justified, Œµ thresholds specified, CI/CD guidance present.

**Detailed Spec Text:** See crypto-peer-reviewer's Recommended Action #2.

---

### HIGH (SHOULD Implement, Workarounds Exist)

**Recommendation 3: Explicitly Require Constant-Time DEM Tag Verification**

**Priority:** HIGH (SHOULD)
**Category:** Specification Clarification

**Action:** Modify Line 374 to add:

```markdown
DEM decryption MUST use constant-time tag verification: compute MAC for both success
and failure cases, use constant-time comparison (e.g., `subtle::ConstantTimeEq`),
constant-time selection to return plaintext (success) or dummy (failure). Implementations
MUST NOT use early-abort patterns (e.g., `if !verify_tag() { return Err }`).
```

**Rationale:** Eliminates 1-5Œºs timing difference between valid/invalid tag verification paths. Prevents correlation attacks identifying malicious armers.

**Workaround:** Experienced constant-time developers will infer this from "no early returns". This recommendation makes it **explicit**.

**Acceptance Criterion:** Explicit prohibition of early-abort on MAC failure, constant-time selection requirement added to spec.

**Detailed Spec Text:** See crypto-peer-reviewer's Recommended Action #3.

---

**Recommendation 4: Explicitly Require Constant-Time PoCE-B Verification**

**Priority:** HIGH (SHOULD)
**Category:** Specification Clarification

**Action:** Modify Line 375 to add:

```markdown
PoCE-B verification MUST check all k armer shares in constant-time: verify each share's
pairing equation T·µ¢ ?= s·µ¢¬∑G regardless of earlier failures, accumulate results in a
bitmask, report validation outcome only after all k shares are checked. Implementations
MUST NOT use early-abort on first invalid share.
```

**Rationale:** Prevents timing-based correlation attacks that reveal which armer provided malformed PoCE-A proofs. Important for threshold settings with large k.

**Workaround:** Implementers familiar with constant-time verification will infer this from general "constant-time" guidance.

**Acceptance Criterion:** Explicit requirement to verify all k shares, deferred error reporting specified, no early-abort prohibition added.

**Detailed Spec Text:** See crypto-peer-reviewer's Recommended Action #4.

---

### MEDIUM (Recommended Improvements)

**Recommendation 5: Add Formal State Machine**

**Priority:** MEDIUM (SHOULD)
**Category:** Specification Enhancement (Optional)

**Action:** Add new section ¬ß12.3 State Machine with:
1. 8 states: IDLE, ARMING, PRE_SIGNING, AWAITING_PROOF, DECAP, BROADCAST, COMPLETED, ABORTED
2. Transition conditions (e.g., ARMING ‚Üí PRE_SIGNING: all k shares received within 120s)
3. Invariants: I1 (ctx_hash immutable after ARMING), I2 (adaptor non-reuse), I3 (CSV > timeouts), I4 (ABORTED terminal)

**Rationale:** Improves auditability and testability. Formal states make it easier to verify correct protocol execution.

**Workaround:** v2.7's timeout values (120s, 180s, CSV Œî) provide liveness protection. Implementers can derive implicit state machine.

**Acceptance Criterion:** Formal state definitions, transition conditions, 4 invariants specified.

**Detailed Spec Text:** See crypto-peer-reviewer's Recommended Action #5.

---

**Recommendation 6: Add Cache-Timing Testing Guidance**

**Priority:** MEDIUM (SHOULD)
**Category:** Implementation Guidance

**Action:** Modify Line 377 to add:

```markdown
Cache-timing validation (SHOULD): Implementations SHOULD validate cache resistance using
Flush+Reload simulation, Prime+Probe simulation, performance counter monitoring (Intel PT,
ARM PMU). Recommended tool: ctgrind (constant-time validation by Adam Langley).
```

**Rationale:** Provides actionable methodology for validating cache-timing resistance claims. Supplements library-level constant-time guarantees with testing.

**Workaround:** Trust library documentation (blst explicitly provides cache-timing resistance).

**Acceptance Criterion:** Validation methodology for cache-timing (Flush+Reload, Prime+Probe, ctgrind) added to spec.

**Detailed Spec Text:** See crypto-peer-reviewer's Recommended Action #6.

---

**Recommendation 7: Add Library Validation Guidance**

**Priority:** MEDIUM (SHOULD)
**Category:** Implementation Guidance

**Action:** Modify Line 390 to add:

```markdown
**Recommended pairing libraries with validated constant-time properties:**
- blst (Rust/C): Constant-time by default, used by Ethereum, extensive audit history
- arkworks (Rust): Enable `asm` and `constant_time` features for constant-time execution
- MCL (C++): Use `MCL_USE_CONSTANT_TIME` compilation flag

Implementations MUST document: (1) library name/version, (2) feature flags enabled,
(3) cache-timing validation evidence.

Avoid libraries without constant-time guarantees (e.g., PBC, RELIC without CONSTTIME).
```

**Rationale:** Prevents implementers from choosing libraries with poor constant-time properties. Provides actionable library selection guidance.

**Workaround:** Cryptography-aware implementers will research appropriate libraries.

**Acceptance Criterion:** Recommended libraries, feature flags, documentation requirements, libraries-to-avoid specified.

**Detailed Spec Text:** See crypto-peer-reviewer's Recommended Action #7.

---

### LOW (Optional Enhancements)

**Recommendation 8: Add Front-Running Mitigation Guidance**

**Priority:** LOW (MAY)
**Category:** Operational Guidance (Optional)

**Action:** Add new section ¬ß12.4 Front-Running Mitigations:

```markdown
### 12.4 Front-Running Mitigations (Optional)

After decapsulation, a front-running window exists before Bitcoin broadcast. Mitigation
strategies (SHOULD consider for high-value contracts):
- Encrypted mempool (Flashbots Protect)
- Direct miner submission (bypass public mempool)
- Commit-reveal (split transaction with timelock)

Note: Operational concern, not protocol vulnerability. CPFP anchor provides baseline defense.
```

**Rationale:** Provides guidance on known operational attack vector without overspecifying deployment details.

**Workaround:** Operational countermeasures (private mempool, direct miner APIs).

**Acceptance Criterion:** Front-running mitigation strategies documented with caveat that this is operational, not protocol-level.

**Detailed Spec Text:** See crypto-peer-reviewer's Recommended Action #8.

---

## Production Readiness Assessment

**Overall Determination:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **CONDITIONALLY ACCEPTABLE**

v2.7 is **production-ready IF AND ONLY IF** implementations adopt:

### Mandatory Implementation Hardening

1. **Fixed 96 Pairing Loop (Algorithmic Constant-Time):**
   - Implement fixed loop iteration count (96 pairings)
   - Pad with dummy pairings: e(G‚ÇÅ_identity, D‚ÇÅ,‚ÇÄ) for i ‚â• m‚ÇÅ
   - **Verify:** Total execution time independent of m‚ÇÅ, m‚ÇÇ

2. **TOST Statistical Validation:**
   - Test: (m‚ÇÅ=10,m‚ÇÇ=10) vs (m‚ÇÅ=48,m‚ÇÇ=48), n ‚â• 10‚Å∂ samples
   - Method: TOST with Œµ < 2^-40 equivalence bounds
   - **Verify:** Both one-sided tests reject at Œ±=0.05

3. **Constant-Time DEM Tag Verification:**
   - Compute MAC in both success/failure paths
   - Use constant-time comparison (subtle::ConstantTimeEq)
   - Constant-time selection (return plaintext or dummy)
   - **Verify:** No early abort on MAC failure

4. **Constant-Time PoCE-B Verification:**
   - Verify all k shares regardless of failures
   - Accumulate results in bitmask
   - Report outcome after all k checks
   - **Verify:** No early abort on first invalid share

5. **Cache-Resistant Pairing Library:**
   - Use blst (constant-time by default) OR
   - Use arkworks with `asm` + `constant_time` features OR
   - Use MCL with `MCL_USE_CONSTANT_TIME` flag
   - **Verify:** Library documentation confirms cache resistance

### Risk Assessment Without Mandatory Hardening

**If implementations do NOT adopt mandatory hardening:**

| Risk | Severity | Likelihood | Impact |
|------|----------|------------|--------|
| **Zero-Knowledge Violation** | CRITICAL | High (literal spec interpretation permits variable loops) | 10-12 bits witness leakage per observation; complete leakage after O(11) observations |
| **Unverifiable Compliance** | CRITICAL | Certain (no testing methodology) | Implementations cannot prove constant-time claims; auditors cannot validate |
| **DEM Timing Leak** | HIGH | Medium (experienced devs will avoid, but spec doesn't mandate) | 1-5Œºs leak reveals which armers provided malformed ciphertexts |
| **PoCE-B Correlation Attack** | HIGH | Medium | Timing reveals which armer is malicious in threshold settings |

**Overall Risk:** **HIGH** - Core zero-knowledge property at risk due to algorithmic ambiguity.

---

## Comparison to v2.0 Specification

**Evolution:** v2.0 ‚Üí v2.7

| Aspect | v2.0 Status | v2.7 Status | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Constant-Time Language** | Generic "consider constant-time" (non-normative) | "MUST be constant-time" (3 instances, normative) | ‚úÖ **Significant** |
| **Algorithmic Specification** | Absent | Absent | ‚ùå **No change** |
| **Testing Methodology** | Absent | Absent | ‚ùå **No change** |
| **CSV Timeout** | SHOULD (optional) | MUST for production | ‚úÖ **Excellent upgrade** |
| **Per-Phase Timeouts** | Generic mention | Concrete (120s, 180s) | ‚úÖ **Good** |
| **Cache-Timing Awareness** | Absent | Present (line 377) | ‚úÖ **Significant** |
| **State Machine** | Absent | Absent | ‚ùå **No change** |
| **Front-Running** | Absent | Absent | ‚ùå **No change** |

**Net Assessment:** **Substantial progress** in normative language and liveness protection, but **critical algorithmic gaps** persist from v2.0.

## Session Notes

**Validation Duration:** 45 minutes (detailed analysis + crypto-peer-reviewer consultation)

**Key Decision Points:**
1. **Decision to Consult Expert:** Medium severity + Enhanced status + side-channel complexity ‚Üí Crypto-peer-reviewer consultation appropriate
2. **Expert Vote:** PARTIAL (strong normative language but critical algorithmic/verifiability gaps)
3. **Lead Auditor Concurrence:** Agree with PARTIAL assessment

**Surprising Findings:**
1. **CSV Upgrade:** "MUST for production" with "not optional" language is **excellent** - significantly stronger than v2.0
2. **Cache-Timing Awareness:** "Avoid cache-tunable table leakage" is **sophisticated** for protocol spec - rare to see
3. **Algorithmic Ambiguity:** Despite 3 instances of "MUST be constant-time", the spec permits ZK-violating interpretations

**Validation Challenges:**
1. **Interpretation Ambiguity:** "Constant-time decap" has two valid interpretations (fixed vs. variable loop count)
2. **Absence of Testing:** No objective way to verify "MUST be constant-time" compliance
3. **Balance:** Strong normative intent vs. weak algorithmic enforcement
