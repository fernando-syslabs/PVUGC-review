## Quick Reference Table

| Code | Title | Severity (M2) | Status (M2) | File | Notes |
|------|-------|----------|--------|------| --- |
| **PVUGC-001** | GT-XPDH Assumption | 🔴 **Critical** | ⚠️ Enhanced | [PVUGC-001.md](PVUGC-001.md) | v2 mitigation is strong, but assumption remains unproven. |
| **PVUGC-002** | GS Commitment Malleability | N/A | ✅ Resolved/Validated | [PVUGC-002.md](PVUGC-002.md) | v2 mitigation (binding CRS) is formally validated. |
| **PVUGC-003** | Independence Property | 🔴 **Critical** | ⚠️ Enhanced | [PVUGC-003.md](PVUGC-003.md) | `MUST` clause insufficient; normative ceremony required. |
| **PVUGC-004** | PoCE Soundness | 🟠 **High** | ✅ Resolved/Validated | [PVUGC-004.md](PVUGC-004.md) | Spec fix present; verify implementation. |
| **PVUGC-005** | Context Binding | 🟢 **Low** | ⚠️ Enhanced | [PVUGC-005.md](PVUGC-005.md) | v2 sound; recommend epoch_nonce. |
| **PVUGC-006** | Degenerate Values | 🟡 **Medium** | ⚠️ Enhanced | [PVUGC-006.md](PVUGC-006.md) | First-order checks are resolved. Novel collusive vector found. |
| **PVUGC-007** | Timing Attacks | 🟡 **Medium** | ⚠️ Enhanced | [PVUGC-007.md](PVUGC-007.md) | Must be normative. Proposed state machine & constant-time spec. |
| **PVUGC-008** | MuSig2 Compartmentalization | 🟠 **High** | ❌ Refuted | [PVUGC-008.md](PVUGC-008.md) | `MUST` clause insufficient. Deterministic nonce required. |
| **PVUGC-009** | Key-Committing DEM | N/A | ✅ Resolved | [PVUGC-009.md](PVUGC-009.md) | v2 profile is formally validated. |
| **PVUGC-010** | CRS Validation | N/A | ✅ Resolved | [PVUGC-010.md](PVUGC-010.md) | v2 principles are sound. Proposed canonical algorithm. |

## Status Legend (M2)

- ✅ **Resolved/Validated**: The v2.0 mitigation is sound and formally validated, or the original concern is fully addressed.
- ⚠️ **Enhanced**: The issue remains open but has been clarified with formalisms, attack models, or concrete mitigation proposals.
- ❌ **Refuted**: The v2.0 mitigation is deemed insufficient to prevent a practical attack.
- 🆕 **Novel**: A new issue discovered during the peer review process.
