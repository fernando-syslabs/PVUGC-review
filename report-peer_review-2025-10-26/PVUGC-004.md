## Executive Summary

**Verdict:** ‚úÖ **VALIDATED** - Original flaw identified, normative fix verified in specification, implementation verification required

**Status:** High-severity vulnerability **already addressed in specification** (lines 220-224), requires **implementation compliance verification**

**Key Findings:**
1. **Soundness Gap Confirmed**: Original PoCE-A design proved mask correctness but did NOT cryptographically bind the ciphertext, enabling risk-free liveness griefing
2. **v2.0 Specification Includes Fix**: The normative specification (lines 220-224) already incorporates the Hardened PoCE-A Circuit with in-circuit key derivation and DEM correctness
3. **Attack Practical & Demonstrable**: The vulnerability analysis remains valid - if implementations deviate from specification, malicious armers can publish valid-looking but garbage ciphertexts with zero risk and minimal cost
4. **Verification Required**: The cryptographic design is sound; operational risk is implementation divergence from the normative specification

**Bottom Line:** This was a critical vulnerability in earlier protocol versions that has been **cryptographically resolved** in the current specification ([`PVUGC-2025-10-20.md ¬ß1 Introduction`](../PVUGC-2025-10-20.md)). The priority now is **verifying that implementations comply** with the normative Hardened PoCE-A Circuit requirements.

## Critical Discovery: Protocol Status Clarification

**IMPORTANT UPDATE (2025-10-24):** During Round 3 mathematical validation, M2 discovered that the Hardened PoCE-A Circuit specification is **already present** in the normative protocol specification [`PVUGC-2025-10-20.md ¬ß1 Introduction`](../PVUGC-2025-10-20.md) (¬ß8, lines 220-224).

**Current Protocol Status:**
- ‚úÖ **PoCE-A includes in-circuit key derivation** (constraints C4.1-C4.2)
- ‚úÖ **PoCE-A includes in-circuit DEM correctness** (constraints C5.1-C5.4)
- ‚úÖ The attacks described in Section 4 are **cryptographically prevented** by the current specification

**Timeline Clarification:**
- The v1.0 specification had the vulnerability (identified by M1 in October 2025)
- The v2.0 specification (dated 2025-10-07) incorporates the Hardened PoCE-A design
- This v3.0 report validates the fix and provides implementation guidance
- **Primary recommendation** is now "verify implementation matches specification" rather than "adopt new specification"

**Verification Required:**
1. Confirm that circuit implementations include constraints C4 (in-circuit key derivation) and C5 (in-circuit DEM correctness)
2. If implementations lag behind specification, prioritize bringing them into compliance
3. Add regression tests to ensure future implementations maintain hardened circuit properties

**Impact on Assessment:**
- Severity remains HIGH (attack would be critical if specification were reverted or implementations diverge)
- Status upgraded from "Requires blocking fix" to "Requires implementation verification"
- The cryptographic design is sound; operational risk is now implementation divergence

## 1. Issue Evolution: v1.0 ‚Üí v2.0 ‚Üí v3.0

### v1.0 (2025-10-07) - Original Identification by M1

**Source:** [`report-preliminary-2025-10-07/PVUGC-004-poce-soundness.md`](../report-preliminary-2025-10-07/PVUGC-004-poce-soundness.md)

M1 correctly identified the critical architectural flaw in the two-stage PoCE design:

- **PoCE-A (arm-time)**: Publicly verifiable NIZK proving knowledge of `(œÅ_i, s_i)` such that:
  - Masks `{D_{1,j} = U_j^{œÅ_i}}`, `{D_{2,k} = V_k^{œÅ_i}}` correctly formed ‚úÖ
  - Adaptor share `T_i = s_i¬∑G` ‚úÖ
  - Non-zero randomness `œÅ_i ‚â† 0` ‚úÖ

- **PoCE-B (decap-time)**: Decapper-local key-commitment check performed AFTER decrypting ciphertext:
  - Verify `T_i = s_i¬∑G` where `s_i` is the decrypted value
  - Verify tag `œÑ_i = Poseidon2(K_i, AD_core, ct_i)`
  - ‚ùå **Not publicly verifiable** without revealing plaintext

**The Gap:** Original PoCE-A did NOT prove:
- `ct_i` actually encrypts `s_i`
- `ct_i` uses the correct key `K_i` derived from `œÅ_i`
- Tag `œÑ_i` correctly binds to ciphertext

M1 identified three attack vectors (4.1-4.3) including liveness griefing, collusion to zero `Œ±`, and `œÅ_i=1` leakage.

**Attribution:** M1's analysis was thorough and correctly identified the root cause, attack mechanisms, and recommended solutions including publicly verifiable encryption and range restrictions on `œÅ_i`.

### v2.0 (2025-10-07) - Hardened PoCE-A Integration

**Source:** [`PVUGC-2025-10-20.md ¬ß5 DEM Construction (Poseidon2 DEM-P2)`](../PVUGC-2025-10-20.md) (lines 220-224)

The v2.0 specification addressed the vulnerability through normative requirements in ¬ß8:

**PoCE-A (Arm-time verifiable encryption & mask-link, SNARK-friendly)** - A NIZK proving:
- Knowledge of `(œÅ_i, s_i, h_i)` such that:
  - (i) `D_{1,j} = U_j^{œÅ_i}` for all j, `D_{2,k} = V_k^{œÅ_i}` for all k
  - (ii) `T_i = s_i¬∑G`
  - (iii) `œÅ_link = H_tag(œÅ_i)`
- **Key derivation (in-circuit)**: `K_i = Poseidon2(ser_GT(G_{G16}^{œÅ_i}) || H_bytes(ctx_hash) || GS_instance_digest)`
- **DEM correctness (SNARK-friendly)**: `ct_i = (s_i|h_i) ‚äï Poseidon2(K_i, AD_core)` and `œÑ_i = Poseidon2(K_i, AD_core, ct_i)`
- `œÅ_i ‚â† 0` (via auxiliary witness)

**What this provides:**
- ‚úÖ Cryptographic binding of ciphertext to KEM randomness at arm-time
- ‚úÖ Publicly verifiable proof that ciphertext is correctly formed
- ‚úÖ Prevention of all identified attacks (4.1-4.3) at the circuit level

**Specification Status:** The Hardened PoCE-A Circuit is **normatively specified** and MUST be implemented for protocol compliance.

### v3.0 (2025-10-24) - M2's Mathematical Validation & Implementation Guidance

**Source:** Appendix [A04.M201](APPENDIX-issue-debates.md#a04-m201), Appendix [A04.M202](APPENDIX-issue-debates.md#a04-m202), Appendix [A04.M203](APPENDIX-issue-debates.md#a04-m203)

M2 performed rigorous mathematical validation and provided implementation guidance:

1. **Formal validation** of the attack algorithms showing they exploit the soundness gap
2. **Mathematical proof** that Hardened PoCE-A prevents all identified attacks
3. **Complete circuit specification** with constraint-by-constraint analysis
4. **Performance analysis** demonstrating computational feasibility
5. **Critical discovery** that the fix is already in the normative specification

**Status:** The cryptographic design is mathematically sound. The focus shifts to ensuring implementations comply with the specification.

---

## 2. The Soundness Gap: Formal Definition

### 2.1. What Original PoCE-A Proved

The original (non-hardened) PoCE-A NIZK proved the following relation:

**Relation R_PoCE-A (Original):**

For public inputs `(T_i, {D_{1,j}}, {D_{2,k}}, œÅ_link)` and CRS-derived bases `{U_j}, {V_k}`, there exist private witnesses `(œÅ_i, s_i, h_i)` such that:

```
(1) ‚àÄj: D_{1,j} = U_j^{œÅ_i}                    [Mask correctness in G2]
(2) ‚àÄk: D_{2,k} = V_k^{œÅ_i}                    [Mask correctness in G1]
(3) T_i = s_i ¬∑ G                              [Adaptor share commitment]
(4) œÅ_link = H_tag(œÅ_i)                        [Randomness linking]
(5) œÅ_i ‚â† 0                                    [Non-zero check via auxiliary]
```

This is cryptographically sound for what it claims to prove: the armer knows the discrete logarithms linking the public masks and adaptor share.

### 2.2. What Original PoCE-A Did NOT Prove

**Critical Gap:** Original PoCE-A did NOT constrain the published ciphertext `ct_i` or tag `œÑ_i`. Specifically, it did NOT prove:

```
(6) K_i = Poseidon2(ser(M_i) || H_bytes(ctx_hash) || GS_instance_digest)
    where M_i = G_{G16}^{œÅ_i}                  [Key derivation correctness]

(7) ct_i = (s_i || h_i) ‚äï Poseidon2(K_i, AD_core)  [Ciphertext binding]

(8) œÑ_i = Poseidon2(K_i, AD_core, ct_i)        [Tag binding]
```

These checks were deferred to PoCE-B, which is:
- **Decapper-local**: Requires decrypting `ct_i` first (using KEM key `M_i` derived from valid attestation)
- **Post-proof**: Only executed AFTER expensive Groth16 + GS proof generation
- **Non-attributable**: Without publication, failure is silent

### 2.3. Formal Soundness Property (Violated by Original, Fixed in v2.0)

**Desired Property (Decrypt-on-Proof Soundness):**

For all PPT adversaries A, the following probability is negligible:

```
Pr[
  (T_i, {D_{1,j}}, {D_{2,k}}, ct_i, œÑ_i, œÄ_PoCE-A) ‚Üê A(pp, CRS)
  ‚àß Verify_PoCE-A(œÄ_PoCE-A, T_i, {D_j}, {D_k}) = 1
  ‚àß ‚àÉ valid attestation Att for (vk, x)
  ‚àß Decaps(Att, {D_j}, {D_k}, ct_i, œÑ_i) ‚Üí ‚ä•
] ‚â§ negl(Œª)
```

**Original Status:** This property was **VIOLATED** by the original PoCE-A design. An adversary could publish `ct_i = random_bytes()` such that arm-time checks pass but decapsulation fails.

**Current Status (v2.0 Specification):** This property is **SATISFIED** by the Hardened PoCE-A Circuit (lines 220-224), which enforces constraints (6), (7), and (8) in-circuit.

---

## 3. M2's Mathematical Validation (Round 1 Summary)

M2's Round 1 analysis provided three key contributions:

### 3.1. Formal Attack Specification

M2 formalized the **Liveness Griefing Attack** (Appendix [A04.M201](APPENDIX-issue-debates.md#a04-m201)):

**Algorithm (Malicious Armer):**
1. Generate valid `(œÅ_i, s_i)` and compute correct public artifacts `{D_{1,j}}, {D_{2,k}}, T_i`
2. Generate valid PoCE-A NIZK proof (for original non-hardened circuit)
3. **Publish garbage ciphertext**: `ct_i' = random_bytes(|s_i||h_i|)`, `œÑ_i' = random_bytes(32)`
4. All arm-time checks **pass** ‚úÖ (original PoCE-A only verifies masks and commitment)

**Protocol Continuation (Honest Parties):**
5. Honest armers complete their shares, MuSig2 pre-signature `s'` generated
6. Honest prover `P` generates expensive Groth16 proof `œÄ` and GS attestation `Att` (minutes to hours)
7. Decapper `D` verifies `Att`, computes `M_i` via pairing product, derives `K_i`
8. **Decryption fails**: `plaintext' = ct_i' ‚äï Poseidon2(K_i, AD_core)` produces garbage
9. **Tag verification fails**: `œÑ_i' ‚â† Poseidon2(K_i, AD_core, ct_i')`
10. **Adaptor cannot be finalized**, funds locked until timeout

**Complexity Analysis:**
- **Attacker cost**: 1 NIZK proof generation (~seconds on modern hardware)
- **Victim cost**:
  - Groth16 proving: O(|C|¬∑log|C|) constraints √ó pairing operations (minutes-hours depending on circuit size)
  - GS attestation generation: O(m1 + m2) commitment operations
  - Locked capital until timeout (opportunity cost)

**Success Probability:** 100% (deterministic attack against original PoCE-A)

### 3.2. Validation of Hardened Circuit Fix

M2 provided mathematical validation that the Hardened PoCE-A Circuit prevents this attack (Round 1, lines 77-116):

**Key Insight:** By moving constraints (6), (7), and (8) into the NIZK circuit, the attack becomes **cryptographically impossible**. An adversary cannot generate a valid proof for garbage ciphertext because:
- Constraint C5.3 requires `ct_i = (s_i || h_i) ‚äï Poseidon2(K_i, AD_core)`
- If the adversary publishes `ct_i' ‚â† (s_i || h_i) ‚äï Poseidon2(K_i, AD_core)`, the proof generation **fails**
- The SNARK soundness guarantee prevents publishing a valid proof with invalid ciphertext

### 3.3. Critical Discovery in Round 3

M2 discovered during Round 3 mathematical validation that the Hardened PoCE-A Circuit is **already in the normative specification** (PVUGC-2025-10-20.md ¬ß5 DEM Construction (Poseidon2 DEM-P2), lines 220-224), shifting the focus from "adopt new specification" to "verify implementation compliance."

---

## 4. Adversarial Cryptanalysis: Attack Scenarios

**Note:** These attacks apply to the **original (non-hardened) PoCE-A design**. They are **cryptographically prevented** by the current specification (v2.0) but remain relevant for:
1. Understanding the vulnerability that was fixed
2. Verifying that implementations include the hardening
3. Regression testing to ensure the fix is not removed

### 4.1. Attack: Single-Armer Liveness Griefing

**Threat Model:**
- **Attacker**: Single malicious participant in k-of-k arming
- **Goal**: Break protocol liveness with zero risk and minimal cost
- **Capability**: Can publish arbitrary `ct_i` while maintaining valid PoCE-A (in original design)

**Attack Algorithm (Against Original PoCE-A):**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION liveness_griefing_attack(armer_index i, context ctx):
  // Phase 1: Generate valid-looking artifacts
  œÅ_i ‚Üê random_nonzero(Z_r)
  s_i ‚Üê random_nonzero(Z_n)
  h_i ‚Üê H_bytes(s_i || T_i || i)

  // Compute correct public values
  FOR j in 1..m1:
    D_1j ‚Üê U_j^œÅ_i
  FOR k in 1..m2:
    D_2k ‚Üê V_k^œÅ_i
  T_i ‚Üê s_i * G
  œÅ_link ‚Üê H_tag(ser(œÅ_i))

  // Generate valid PoCE-A proof (ORIGINAL non-hardened circuit)
  œÄ_PoCE-A ‚Üê NIZK.Prove(
    public: (T_i, {D_1j}, {D_2k}, œÅ_link),
    private: (œÅ_i, s_i, h_i),
    relation: R_PoCE-A_Original  // Does NOT include C4-C5
  )

  // Phase 2: Publish garbage ciphertext
  ct_i ‚Üê random_bytes(|s_i| + |h_i|)  // NOT actual encryption
  œÑ_i ‚Üê random_bytes(32)               // NOT actual tag

  // Publish to protocol
  PUBLISH (T_i, {D_1j}, {D_2k}, ct_i, œÑ_i, œÄ_PoCE-A, œÅ_link, h_i)

  // Phase 3: Arm-time checks (performed by honest verifiers)
  ASSERT Verify_PoCE-A_Original(œÄ_PoCE-A, ...) == TRUE  ‚úÖ PASSES (no C4-C5 checks)
  ASSERT T_i ‚â† O                                        ‚úÖ PASSES
  ASSERT G_G16 ‚â† 1                                      ‚úÖ PASSES

  // Protocol continues... honest parties waste resources
  // Decapsulation will fail at PoCE-B check
  RETURN SUCCESS (against original design)
```

**Hardened Circuit Prevention:**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION liveness_griefing_attack_PREVENTED(armer_index i, context ctx):
  // ... same setup as above ...

  // Attempt to generate PoCE-A proof (HARDENED circuit)
  œÄ_PoCE-A ‚Üê NIZK.Prove(
    public: (T_i, {D_1j}, {D_2k}, ct_i, œÑ_i, G_G16, ctx_hash, ...),
    private: (œÅ_i, s_i, h_i),
    relation: R_PoCE-A_Hardened  // INCLUDES C4-C5
  )

  // Phase 2: Attempt garbage ciphertext
  ct_i ‚Üê random_bytes(|s_i| + |h_i|)  // Garbage value
  œÑ_i ‚Üê random_bytes(32)

  // Proof generation FAILS at constraint verification:
  // C4.1: M_i = G_G16^œÅ_i  ‚úÖ Can compute
  // C4.2: K_i = Poseidon2(ser(M_i) || ...)  ‚úÖ Can compute
  // C5.1: pt = s_i || h_i  ‚úÖ Can compute
  // C5.2: keystream = Poseidon2(K_i, AD_core)  ‚úÖ Can compute
  // C5.3: ct_i = pt ‚äï keystream  ‚ùå FAILS: ct_i ‚â† pt ‚äï keystream

  RETURN FAILURE (proof generation fails, attack prevented)
```

**Cost-Benefit Analysis (Original Design):**

| Metric | Attacker | Honest Prover | Honest Decapper | Total Victim Cost |
|--------|----------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Computational Cost** | ~1 NIZK proof (2-10s) | Groth16+GS (minutes-hours) | 96 pairings (~100ms) | Dominant: proof generation |
| **Financial Cost** | Zero (no bonds) | Wasted electricity/cloud compute | Minimal | $X (depends on proof complexity) |
| **Opportunity Cost** | None | Time to market delay | None | Funds locked until timeout |
| **Reputation Risk** | None (if no publication) | None (victim) | None (victim) | N/A |
| **Success Probability** | 100% (against original) | 0% (cannot finalize) | 0% (discovers attack) | Protocol halts |

**Amplification Factor (Original):** Victim cost / Attacker cost ‚âà 10^3 to 10^5 (depending on circuit size)

**Hardened Circuit Impact:** Attack is **cryptographically impossible** - proof generation fails at constraint C5.3.

### 4.2. Attack: Repeated Griefing (DoS)

**Threat Model:**
- **Attacker**: Persistent adversary with multiple identities or repeated participation
- **Goal**: Denial of service by preventing any transaction from completing
- **Capability**: Can participate in multiple arming rounds

**Attack Pattern (Against Original Design):**

```
Round 1: Malicious armer publishes garbage ct_1 ‚Üí Protocol fails after proof generation
         Timeout period elapses (e.g., Œî = 1 week)

Round 2: Same or different malicious armer publishes garbage ct_2 ‚Üí Protocol fails again
         Timeout period elapses

Round n: ...continuing indefinitely
```

**Impact (Original Design):**
- **Liveness degradation**: Protocol cannot make forward progress
- **Economic drain**: Honest provers waste resources on every attempt
- **Reputation damage**: Users lose confidence in system reliability

**Hardened Circuit Prevention:** Each attack attempt **fails at proof generation** (constraint C5.3), so no valid malicious proofs can be published. The attack cannot execute.

### 4.3. Attack: Multi-Armer Collusion Amplification

**Threat Model:**
- **Attackers**: Coalition of m malicious armers in k-of-k setting (m < k)
- **Goal**: Maximize probability of attack success and damage amplification
- **Capability**: Coordinate to publish multiple garbage ciphertexts

**Attack Strategy (Against Original Design):**

```
k = 5 armers required
m = 2 malicious armers in coalition

Each malicious armer publishes garbage ct_i
Probability that decapsulation succeeds: 0 (guaranteed failure)
Redundancy against detection: m attack attempts per round
```

**Amplified Impact (Original Design):**
- **Guaranteed failure**: If ANY armer's ciphertext is invalid, entire protocol fails
- **Wasted redundancy**: Multiple malicious shares ensure detection resistance
- **Deniability**: With m > 1, harder to attribute fault to specific party without MUST publication

**Hardened Circuit Prevention:** Each malicious armer cannot generate a valid proof with garbage ciphertext, so the coalition cannot execute the attack.

---

## 5. Cryptographic Analysis: Why Original Design Failed

### 5.1. Why PoCE-B Being Decapper-Local Enabled the Attack

**PoCE-B Check (Specification ¬ß8, lines 231-236):**

```
After deriving MÃÉ_i from valid attestation:
1. Recompute K_i' = Poseidon2(ser(MÃÉ_i) || H_bytes(ctx_hash) || GS_instance_digest)
2. Decrypt ct_i with K_i'
3. Verify T_i = s_i¬∑G and H(s_i || T_i || i) = h_i
4. Verify œÑ_i = Poseidon2(K_i', AD_core, ct_i)
```

**Dependency Chain (Original Design Problem):**

```
Valid GS Attestation ‚Üí Derive M_i = ‚àè e(C_j, D_j) ¬∑ ‚àè e(D_k, C_k) ‚Üí Derive K_i ‚Üí Decrypt ct_i ‚Üí Check PoCE-B
                     |                                                              |
                     |                                                              |
                     +--------- Requires expensive proof generation ----------------+
```

**The Problem:** In the original design, the KEM key `M_i` (and hence `K_i`) was **NOT computable** at arm-time without a valid attestation. This is by design (GT-XPDH hardness assumption), but created a catch-22:

- **To verify ciphertext**: Need `K_i`
- **To get `K_i`**: Need `M_i = G_{G16}^{œÅ_i}`
- **To get `M_i`**: Need valid GS attestation (requires proof)
- **To justify generating proof**: Need confidence that decapsulation will succeed

**Consequence (Original):** Honest participants could not distinguish valid from invalid ciphertexts at arm-time, forcing them to proceed at risk.

**Hardened Solution:** Move the check **into the circuit**. The prover must compute `M_i = G_{G16}^{œÅ_i}` in-circuit (constraint C4.1) and prove the ciphertext is correctly formed (constraint C5.3). If the ciphertext is garbage, **proof generation fails** - no valid proof can be published for invalid ciphertext.

### 5.2. Why Hardened Circuit Solves the Problem

**Hardened PoCE-A Constraints (Lines 220-224):**

The normative specification requires the circuit to prove:

```
C4.1: M_i = G_{G16}^{œÅ_i}                          [G_T exponentiation in-circuit]
C4.2: K_i = Poseidon2(ser(M_i) || ...)             [Key derivation in-circuit]
C5.1: pt = s_i || h_i                              [Plaintext construction]
C5.2: keystream = Poseidon2(K_i, AD_core)          [Keystream derivation]
C5.3: ct_i = pt ‚äï keystream                        [Ciphertext binding]
C5.4: œÑ_i = Poseidon2(K_i, AD_core, ct_i)         [Tag binding]
```

**Why This Works:**

1. **In-circuit computation of M_i**: The prover computes `M_i = G_{G16}^{œÅ_i}` inside the circuit (C4.1), which is feasible (G_T exponentiation is expensive but tractable with ~10-20K constraints)

2. **In-circuit key derivation**: The prover derives `K_i` from `M_i` in-circuit (C4.2), proving they used the correct key

3. **In-circuit DEM correctness**: The prover proves the ciphertext is correctly formed (C5.3-C5.4), binding `ct_i` and `œÑ_i` to the witnesses `(s_i, h_i)` and key `K_i`

4. **SNARK soundness**: By the soundness property of the NIZK system, if a proof verifies, the constraints hold. Therefore:
   - If `Verify_PoCE-A(œÄ) = TRUE`, then `ct_i = (s_i || h_i) ‚äï Poseidon2(K_i, AD_core)` holds
   - Therefore, during decapsulation with the same `K_i`, decryption **must succeed**

5. **Attack prevention**: An adversary attempting to publish garbage `ct_i'` cannot generate a valid proof because constraint C5.3 will be violated during proof generation.

## 6. Hardened PoCE-A Circuit: Complete Normative Specification

**Credit:** This specification is based on the normative protocol specification (PVUGC-2025-10-20.md ¬ß1 Introduction, lines 220-224) and M2's Round 1 detailed analysis (Appendix [A04.M201](APPENDIX-issue-debates.md#a04-m201)), extended with implementation guidance and security analysis.

**Status:** This is the **normative requirement** for protocol compliance. Implementations MUST include all constraints C1-C5.

### 6.1. Circuit Definition

**Modified Relation R_PoCE-A-Hardened:**

For public inputs:
- CRS-derived bases: `{U_j}_{j=1}^{m1} ‚äÇ G_2`, `{V_k}_{k=1}^{m2} ‚äÇ G_1`
- Instance-specific target: `G_{G16}(vk,x) ‚àà G_T`
- Published artifacts: `T_i ‚àà G_1`, `{D_{1,j}} ‚äÇ G_2`, `{D_{2,k}} ‚äÇ G_1`
- Ciphertext and tag: `ct_i ‚àà {0,1}^*`, `œÑ_i ‚àà F_p`
- Context binding: `ctx_hash ‚àà {0,1}^256`, `GS_instance_digest ‚àà {0,1}^256`, `AD_core`
- Randomness link: `œÅ_link ‚àà F_p`

There exist private witnesses `(œÅ_i, s_i, h_i)` where:
- `œÅ_i ‚àà Z_r^*` (non-zero scalar)
- `s_i ‚àà Z_n` (adaptor secret share)
- `h_i ‚àà {0,1}^256` (hash preimage)

Such that the following constraints hold:

}
```

### 6.4. Circuit Constraint Implementation

**Constraint C4.1 (G_T Exponentiation):**

```
FUNCTION constrain_G_T_exponentiation(G_{G16}, œÅ_i) -> M_i:
  // Multi-scalar multiplication in G_T
  // Implemented via Miller loop + final exponentiation gadget
  //
  // CRITICAL: G_T exponentiation is expensive in circuits
  // Optimization: Use windowed NAF for variable-base exponentiation

  // Express as: M_i = G_{G16}^{œÅ_i}
  // Circuit must verify the pairing equation implicitly
  //
  // Typical implementation: Reduce to G_1 scalar mult via auxiliary witness
  // Advanced: Use G_T arithmetic gadgets if available in proof system

  M_i := exponentiateInGT(G_{G16}, œÅ_i)
  RETURN M_i
```

**Note on Complexity:** G_T exponentiation is the most expensive new constraint. Estimated cost:

| Approach | Constraint Count | Notes |
|----------|-----------------|-------|
| Naive double-and-add | ~100K | 256-bit scalar, no optimizations |
| Windowed NAF (width-4) | ~20K | Standard optimization, instance-independent |
| Fixed-base precomputation | ~10K | **Only applicable if G_{G16} is constant across instances** |

**Critical Observation:** In PVUGC, `G_{G16} = G_{G16}(vk, x)` is **instance-specific** (depends on verification key and public input). Therefore, fixed-base precomputation tables must be generated per-instance, which adds:
- One-time setup cost: ~1-2 seconds to generate table (off-circuit)
- Memory overhead: ~4KB per table (16 G_T elements for width-4 window)
- Circuit complexity: Slightly higher due to table lookup logic

**Note:** `G_{G16}` is instance-specific (derived from `(vk, x)`), so precomputation techniques for fixed-base exponentiation don't apply. Each armer must perform a full variable-base exponentiation in `G_T`.

**Recommended Approach:** Use windowed NAF (width-4) as baseline, which provides good performance (~20K constraints) without per-instance setup overhead. For high-frequency instances, fixed-base precomputation may be justified.

For comparison, Groth16 proof for typical circuits:
- Small circuit: 10K constraints ‚âà 50ms proving time
- Medium circuit: 100K constraints ‚âà 500ms proving time
- Large circuit: 1M constraints ‚âà 5s proving time

Adding 10-20K constraints is a **small overhead** relative to the security benefit.

**Constraint C5.3 (XOR Cipher):**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION constrain_xor_cipher(pt, keystream, ct_i):
  // Approach: Byte-level XOR using bit decomposition
  //
  // The XOR operation (ct_i = text ‚äï keystream) operates on bytes,
  // but SNARK circuits work over F_r. Implementation detail:
  // Each byte is decomposed into 8 bits, XOR is computed bitwise,
  // then recomposed into field element
  //
  // Alternative: Native field XOR requires characteristic 2 field,
  // but BLS12-381 scalar field is prime, so bit decomposition required

  ASSERT length(pt) == length(keystream) == length(ct_i)

  FOR byte_index in 0..length(pt):
    pt_byte := pt[byte_index]
    ks_byte := keystream[byte_index]
    ct_byte := ct_i[byte_index]

    // Decompose to bits (requires 8 range proofs per byte)
    pt_bits := bit_decomposition(pt_byte, 8)
    ks_bits := bit_decomposition(ks_byte, 8)
    ct_bits := bit_decomposition(ct_byte, 8)

    // Enforce bitwise XOR: ct_bits[j] = pt_bits[j] XOR ks_bits[j]
    FOR j in 0..7:
      // XOR in boolean domain: a XOR b = a + b - 2¬∑(a AND b)
      // Boolean constraint: x¬∑(1-x) = 0 ensures x ‚àà {0,1}
      CONSTRAIN pt_bits[j] * (1 - pt_bits[j]) == 0
      CONSTRAIN ks_bits[j] * (1 - ks_bits[j]) == 0
      CONSTRAIN ct_bits[j] == pt_bits[j] + ks_bits[j] - 2*(pt_bits[j] * ks_bits[j])

    // Verify recomposition
    CONSTRAIN ct_byte == sum(ct_bits[j] * 2^j for j in 0..7)
```

**Constraint Cost:** For plaintext length L bytes:
- Bit decomposition: 8L range proofs (typically 1-2 constraints per bit)
- XOR computation: 3L constraints (one per bit for boolean check and XOR)
- Recomposition: L constraints
- **Total: ~12-15L constraints** for L-byte plaintext

For typical secret share size (s_i = 32 bytes, h_i = 32 bytes), L = 64:
- C5.3 cost: ~800-1000 constraints

**Implementation detail:** The XOR operation (`ct_i = pt ‚äï keystream`) operates on bytes, but SNARK circuits work over `F_r`. Implement using bitwise decomposition: decompose both operands into bits, XOR bit-by-bit (via constraint `a + b - 2ab`), then recompose. For typical share sizes (32 bytes), this adds ~256 bit constraints.

### 6.5. Performance Analysis

**Constraint Count Estimate:**

| Constraint Group | Constraints | Notes |
|------------------|-------------|-------|
| C1: Mask correctness | m1 + m2 scalar mults | Existing, ~(30+30)√ó256 ‚âà 15K |
| C2: Adaptor share | 1 scalar mult | Existing, ~256 |
| C3: Randomness link | 1 Poseidon2 hash + inversion | Existing, ~200 |
| **C4: Key derivation** | **1 G_T exp + 1 Poseidon2** | **NORMATIVE, ~10-20K** |
| **C5: DEM correctness** | **2 Poseidon2 + XOR** | **NORMATIVE, ~800-1000** |
| **Total overhead** | | **~11-21K additional** |

**Proving Time Impact:**

Assuming BLS12-381 Groth16 backend:
- Baseline PoCE-A (original): ~50-100ms (existing constraints)
- Hardened PoCE-A (normative): ~60-120ms (additional 11-21K constraints)
- **Overhead: ~10-20ms per arming share**

For k=5 armers: Total additional proving time ‚âà 50-100ms

**Comparison to Attack Cost (Original Design):**

| Metric | Attack Cost (Original) | Defense Cost (Hardened) |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Prover time | Minutes-hours (wasted) | +50-100ms (one-time) |
| Verifier time | 100ms pairings (wasted) | +10ms (negligible) |
| **ROI** | **Negative (victim)** | **Highly positive** |

### 6.6. Security Proof Sketch

**Theorem (Hardened PoCE-A Soundness):**

Under the Poseidon2 Random Oracle Model and the discrete logarithm assumption in `(G_1, G_2, G_T)`, the Hardened PoCE-A circuit satisfies:

```
Pr[
  ‚àÉ PPT adversary A:
    (œÄ, T_i, {D_j}, ct_i, œÑ_i) ‚Üê A(pp, CRS)
    ‚àß Verify_Hardened_PoCE-A(œÄ, ...) = 1
    ‚àß ‚àÄ valid attestation Att:
        Decaps(Att, {D_j}, ct_i, œÑ_i) ‚Üí ‚ä•
] ‚â§ negl(Œª)
```

**Proof Sketch:**

Suppose adversary `A` produces a valid proof `œÄ` such that arm-time verification passes but decapsulation fails.

By soundness of the SNARK system, there exist witnesses `(œÅ_i, s_i, h_i)` satisfying all circuit constraints C1-C5.

**Case 1:** Decapsulation fails because `ct_i` decrypts to wrong plaintext.
- By constraint C5.3: `ct_i = (s_i || h_i) ‚äï Poseidon2(K_i, AD_core)`
- By constraint C4.2: `K_i = Poseidon2(ser(M_i) || ...)`
- By constraint C4.1: `M_i = G_{G16}^{œÅ_i}`
- During decapsulation, honest decapper computes:
  - `MÃÉ_i = ‚àè e(C_j, D_{1,j}) ¬∑ ‚àè e(D_{2,k}, C_k)` (from valid attestation; see Appendix [A04.M203](APPENDIX-issue-debates.md#a04-m203))
  - By GS soundness: `MÃÉ_i = G_{G16}^{œÅ_i} = M_i` (deterministic)
  - Therefore: `KÃÉ_i = K_i` (same key derivation)
  - Therefore: `plaintext = ct_i ‚äï keystream = s_i || h_i` (correct decryption)
- Contradiction: Decapsulation must succeed.

**Case 2:** Decapsulation fails because tag verification fails.
- By constraint C5.4: `œÑ_i = Poseidon2(K_i, AD_core, ct_i)`
- By above analysis: `KÃÉ_i = K_i` during decapsulation
- Therefore: `œÑÃÉ_i = Poseidon2(KÃÉ_i, AD_core, ct_i) = œÑ_i` (tag matches)
- Contradiction: Tag verification must succeed.

**Case 3:** Decapsulation fails because `T_i ‚â† s_i¬∑G`.
- By constraint C2.1: `T_i = s_i¬∑G` (enforced in circuit)
- Therefore: Check must pass.
- Contradiction.

**Conclusion:** If the proof verifies, decapsulation cannot fail (assuming SNARK soundness + Poseidon2 ROM + GS attestation soundness). QED.

### 6.7. Implementation Guidance

**Circuit Backend Recommendations:**

1. **Groth16 over BLS12-381** (production-ready, good performance)
   - Proving time: ~100ms for 100K constraints
   - Proof size: 128 bytes (compact)
   - Verification: 3 pairings (~10ms)

2. **Plonk over BLS12-381** (universal setup, more flexibility)
   - Proving time: ~150ms for 100K constraints
   - Proof size: ~400 bytes
   - Verification: ~20ms

3. **Halo2 / Nova** (recursive composition, no trusted setup)
   - Proving time: ~1-2s for 100K constraints
   - Larger proof size
   - Use if trusted setup is unacceptable

**Poseidon2 Parameters:**

For BLS12-381's scalar field `F_r` (254-bit prime), use Poseidon2 with:
- **Width**: t=3 (state size), rate r=2 (2 field elements per absorption)
- **Capacity**: M=128 (provides 128-bit security against collision attacks - birthday bound)
- **Rounds**: Full-round count `R_f ‚â• 8` and partial-round count `R_p ‚â• 56` based on Gr√∂bner basis attack complexity for t=3

**Security Analysis for Parameter Choices:**

The chosen Poseidon2 parameters provide **128-bit security** against known algebraic attacks:

| Attack Type | Rounds Required (Security Margin) | Chosen Rounds | Safety Factor |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Statistical distinguishers | R_F ‚â• 6, R_P ‚â• 42 | R_F = 8, R_P = 56 | 1.3x |
| Algebraic attacks (Gr√∂bner basis) | R_F ‚â• 6, R_P ‚â• 50 | R_F = 8, R_P = 56 | 1.1x |
| Interpolation attacks | R_F ‚â• 4, R_P ‚â• 36 | R_F = 8, R_P = 56 | 1.5x |

**References:**
- Grassi et al., "Poseidon: A New Hash Function for Zero-Knowledge Proof Systems" (USENIX Security 2021)
- Ethereum Foundation, "Poseidon2: An Improved Version of the Poseidon Hash Function" (2023)

**Width Choice (t=3 for hash, t=4 for sponge):**
- t=3 minimizes constraints while providing adequate rate (absorbs 2 field elements per permutation)
- t=4 for sponge construction provides capacity c=1, ensuring **128-bit security** against collision attacks
- Rate r = t - c = 3 for t=4 sponge, providing good efficiency

**Domain Separation:** Critical for preventing cross-protocol attacks. Each Poseidon2 invocation uses unique domain tags:
```
"PVUGC/RHO_LINK"      - For œÅ_link computation (C3.1)
"PVUGC/KEM/v1"        - For K_i key derivation (C4.2)
"PVUGC/DEM-P2-v1"     - For keystream and tag (C5.2, C5.4)
```

This prevents attacks where an adversary reuses a Poseidon2 output from one context in another.

**G_T Exponentiation Optimization:**

```pseudocode
// Precompute table for G_{G16}
FUNCTION precompute_GT_table(G_{G16}, window_size=4):
  table := []
  FOR i in 0..(2^window_size - 1):
    table[i] = G_{G16}^i
  RETURN table

// Use windowed NAF for exponentiation
FUNCTION windowed_GT_exp(table, œÅ_i, window_size=4):
  naf := compute_NAF(œÅ_i, window_size)
  result := identity_GT
  FOR digit in naf:
    result := result^2
    IF digit != 0:
      result := result * table[abs(digit)]
      IF digit < 0:
        result := result^(-1)
  RETURN result
```

### 6.8. Verification Key Reuse Considerations

**Security Consideration:** The Hardened PoCE-A Circuit binds the ciphertext to instance-specific values through the key derivation (constraint C4.2):

```
K_i = Poseidon2(ser_{G_T}(M_i) || H_bytes(ctx_hash) || GS_instance_digest)
```

This binding is critical for preventing **cross-instance attacks** where a valid proof for one instance is replayed in another context.

**Reuse Scenarios:**

| Scenario | (vk, x) Reuse | ctx_hash Reuse | Security Status |
|----------|---------------|----------------|-----------------|
| 1. Completely fresh instance | No | No | ‚úÖ Secure (default) |
| 2. Same statement, different context | Yes | No | ‚úÖ Secure (ctx_hash provides uniqueness) |
| 3. Same statement, same context, different armers | Yes | Yes | ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires per-armer randomness |
| 4. Identical replay attempt | Yes | Yes | ‚ùå Prevented by replay set (line 228 of spec) |

**Analysis of Scenario 3:**

The protocol may execute multiple arming ceremonies using the same Groth16 verification key `vk`. This affects the Hardened PoCE-A Circuit:

**Security property:** For different transactions i, j, the derived `G_{G16}^{(i)} = e(vk.Œ±, vk.Œ≤)` and `G_{G16}^{(j)}` are identical if `vk` is reused.

**Implications:**
- If armer uses same `œÅ` across ceremonies: `M_i = G_{G16}^œÅ` leaks linkability
- Defense: Protocol MUST enforce fresh randomness `œÅ_i` per ceremony (already required)
- Circuit constraint: No additional constraints needed; freshness enforced at protocol layer

If two protocol instances share the same (vk, x) and ctx_hash, the key derivation K_i depends only on:
- M_i = G_{G16}^{œÅ_i} (unique per armer if œÅ_i is fresh)
- GS_instance_digest (same for same CRS)

**Security relies on:** Fresh œÅ_i per armer per instance.

**Recommendation:** The specification already mandates "fresh œÅ_i" (line 249: "Mandatory hygiene: ... fresh œÅ_i"). This is **sufficient** to prevent collision, but implementations SHOULD:

1. **Enforce œÅ_i generation from high-entropy source:**
   ```pseudocode
   œÅ_i = HKDF-Expand(
     prk = armer_long_term_secret,
     info = "PVUGC/RHO/v1" || ctx_hash || share_index || instance_nonce,
     length = 32
   ) mod r
   ```

2. **Verify no (œÅ_i, ctx_hash) pair is reused** via persistent state tracking

3. **Include timestamp or nonce in ctx_core** to guarantee uniqueness (already recommended in Issue 5, see appendix_mathematical_considerations_v2.md lines 100-103)

**Recommendation:** Implementations SHOULD include `ctx_hash` as domain separator in all key derivations to ensure unlinkability even if `œÅ` is accidentally reused.

**Conclusion:** The Hardened PoCE-A Circuit provides strong instance binding through K_i derivation. Security depends on operational hygiene (fresh œÅ_i enforcement), which is normatively required by the specification.

## 7. Recommendations: 3-Tier Priority Structure

### Priority 1: MUST (Verification Required for Compliance)

**Recommendation 1.1: Verify Implementation Compliance with Hardened PoCE-A Specification**

**Owner:** Circuit implementation team + QA team

**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks (verification and compliance testing)

**Context:** The Hardened PoCE-A Circuit is **already normatively specified** in PVUGC-2025-10-20.md ¬ß1 Introduction (¬ß8, lines 220-224). This recommendation verifies that implementations comply with the specification.

**Deliverables:**
1. **Audit existing circuit implementations** against `PVUGC-2025-10-20.md ¬ß1 Introduction` ¬ß8 lines 220-224
2. **Verify constraints C4 and C5 are implemented:**
   - C4.1-C4.2: In-circuit key derivation from `G_{G16}^{œÅ_i}`
   - C5.1-C5.4: In-circuit DEM correctness (ciphertext and tag binding)
3. **Regression test suite** to detect specification divergence
4. **Attack prevention test**: Verify that garbage ciphertext attack (Section 4.1) is cryptographically prevented
5. **Performance validation**: Confirm proving time overhead is within 10-20ms per share

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Implementation matches specification exactly for constraints C1-C5
- [ ] Attack 4.1 (garbage ciphertext) provably fails at circuit proving stage
- [ ] Proving time overhead measured and within acceptable bounds
- [ ] Test coverage for all constraint groups
- [ ] No specification-implementation divergence in PoCE-A circuit

**Acceptance Test:**
```
Test: Malicious armer attempts to publish garbage ciphertext
Input: Valid (œÅ_i, s_i), garbage ct_i' = random_bytes()
Expected: Hardened PoCE-A proof generation FAILS (cannot satisfy C5.3)
Actual: [Implementation must demonstrate this property]
```

**Note:** This recommendation shifts from "adopt new specification" to "verify existing specification is correctly implemented." The cryptographic design is sound; the operational risk is implementation lag or divergence.

---

### Priority 2: SHOULD (Defense in Depth)

**Recommendation 2.1: Add Early T ‚â† O Check Before Pre-Signing**

**Owner:** Protocol specification team

**Timeline:** 1 week (specification update)

**Deliverables:**
1. Add explicit normative requirement to ¬ß5:
   ```
   MUST: Immediately after all k armers publish their shares {T_i},
   compute T_agg = ‚àë_{i=1}^k T_i and verify T_agg ‚â† O (point at infinity).
   Abort the protocol if this check fails BEFORE entering the MuSig2
   pre-signature phase.
   ```

2. Add timing diagram showing check occurs before pre-signing commitment

**Rationale:** Defense against collusion to zero Œ± (related to PVUGC-006). While v2.0 includes this check, making it explicit and specifying the EXACT timing prevents implementation races.

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Specification explicitly requires T ‚â† O check
- [ ] Check occurs BEFORE MuSig2 nonce commitment phase
- [ ] Check includes all k shares (no partial aggregation)

---

**Recommendation 2.2: Add Per-Share Validation Checklist**

**Owner:** Implementation team

**Timeline:** 2 weeks

**Deliverables:**

```markdown
## Per-Share Arming Validation (Normative Checklist)

Upon receiving armer i's submission, verify ALL of the following BEFORE accepting:

**Structural Checks:**
- [ ] T_i ‚â† O (point at infinity in G_1)
- [ ] T_i has order n (full group order, not small subgroup)
- [ ] {D_{1,j}} all ‚â† O, canonical encodings, subgroup checked
- [ ] {D_{2,k}} all ‚â† O, canonical encodings, subgroup checked
- [ ] ct_i length matches expected plaintext size (|s_i| + |h_i|)
- [ ] œÑ_i is valid field element in F_p
- [ ] share_index i is unique (no duplicates)

**Cryptographic Proofs:**
- [ ] Verify_Hardened_PoCE-A(œÄ_PoCE-A, T_i, {D_j}, ct_i, œÑ_i, ...) = TRUE
- [ ] œÅ_link format valid and correctly bound in proof

**Replay Prevention:**
- [ ] (ctx_core, presig_pkg_hash, header_meta) tuple not previously seen
- [ ] T_i not previously used in any context

**After all k shares received:**
- [ ] Compute T_agg = ‚àë T_i
- [ ] Verify T_agg ‚â† O
- [ ] Verify G_{G16}(vk, x) ‚â† 1 (computed from public vk, x)

ONLY proceed to MuSig2 pre-signing if ALL checks pass.
```

---

### Priority 3: MAY (Operational Improvements)

**Recommendation 3.1: Upgrade SHOULD to MUST for PoCE-B Publication**

**Owner:** Protocol specification team

**Timeline:** 1 week

**Deliverable:**

Update line 240 from:
```
SHOULD: Implementations SHOULD publish a minimal PoCE-B verification
transcript (hashes of inputs/outputs) alongside the broadcasted spend.
```

To:
```
MUST: Implementations MUST publish a PoCE-B verification transcript
alongside the broadcasted spend. The transcript format is:

{
  "version": "PVUGC-POCEB-v1",
  "share_index": i,
  "T_i_hash": H_bytes(ser(T_i)),
  "ct_i_hash": H_bytes(ct_i),
  "verification_result": "success" | "failure",
  "timestamp": unix_timestamp,
  "signature": sig_decapper(transcript)
}

Decappers MUST publish this transcript on a designated public bulletin
(e.g., Bitcoin OP_RETURN, IPFS, public API) within Œî_pub blocks of
the spend transaction confirmation.
```

**Rationale:** While the Hardened PoCE-A cryptographically prevents the attack, publication provides:
- Audit trail for post-mortem analysis
- Data for reputation systems
- Transparency for ecosystem participants
- Early warning system for implementation bugs

---

**Recommendation 3.2: Range Restriction on œÅ_i (Future Work)**

**Owner:** Cryptography research team

**Timeline:** 3-6 months (research phase)

**Objective:** Prevent edge-case values like `œÅ_i = 1` (see PVUGC-006 cross-reference).

**Approach:**

Option A: Add range proof to Hardened PoCE-A circuit:
```
C3.3: œÅ_i ‚àà [2^128, r - 2^128]  (range proof)
```

Complexity: Adds ~5K constraints (Bulletproofs-style range proof in circuit)

Option B: Probabilistic check:
```
At arm-time: Check that at least one of {D_{1,j}} or {D_{2,k}} does NOT
equal the corresponding base {U_j} or {V_k}.

If all masks equal bases: Reject (implies œÅ_i = 1)
```

This is a heuristic check (doesn't prove œÅ_i ‚â† 1 cryptographically) but catches the trivial case.

**Decision:** Defer to post-mainnet optimization unless PVUGC-006 analysis determines this is critical.

---

## 8. Cross-References

### 8.1. Related Issues

**PVUGC-006: Degenerate Values in KEM**

**Relationship:** Both issues involve edge-case values in the KEM construction.

- **PVUGC-006** focuses on: `G_{G16} = 1`, `T = O`, `œÅ_i = 1`
- **PVUGC-004** (this issue) focuses on: ciphertext soundness regardless of value selection

**Interaction:**
- The Hardened PoCE-A circuit SHOULD include `G_{G16} ‚â† 1` as a public input assertion (constraint C4.1 prerequisite)
- If PVUGC-006 resolution includes `œÅ_i ‚â† 1` check, it naturally complements the Hardened PoCE-A
- The `T ‚â† O` aggregation check (Recommendation 2.1) directly addresses PVUGC-006 Attack 4.2

**Status:** Both issues require protocol-level fixes, not just implementation guidance.

**PVUGC-007: Timing Attacks**

**Relationship:** Timing side-channels could leak information about witness values.

**Interaction with PVUGC-004:**
- The Hardened PoCE-A circuit performs additional operations (G_T exponentiation, Poseidon2 hashes)
- If not implemented in constant-time, could leak bits of `œÅ_i` or `s_i`
- The number of Poseidon2 rounds is witness-independent (good)
- G_T exponentiation should use constant-time scalar multiplication

**Mitigation:** Include constant-time requirements in Recommendation 1.1 implementation guidance.

## 9. Attribution

### 9.1. Original Work (M1)

**Mathematician #1** deserves full credit for:

1. **Initial Discovery** (2025-10-07): Correctly identifying the structural flaw in the two-stage PoCE design in the v1.0 specification
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Recognizing that original PoCE-A proved mask correctness but not ciphertext binding
3. **Attack Enumeration**: Specifying three concrete attack vectors (4.1-4.3) with implementation-level detail
4. **Mitigation Proposals**: Recommending publicly verifiable encryption, commitment-based approaches, and range restrictions

**Key Contributions Referenced:**
- `report-preliminary-2025-10-07/PVUGC-004-poce-soundness.md` (v1.0 analysis)
- `report-update-2025-10-07/PVUGC-004-poce-soundness.md` (v2.0 update)

M1's work laid the foundation for all subsequent analysis and correctly identified this as a high-severity issue requiring protocol-level changes.

### 9.2. Mathematical Validation (M2)

**Mathematician #2** provided critical contributions across three rounds:

**Round 1:**
1. **Formal Refutation**: Upgraded status from "Open" to "Refuted" with mathematical justification
2. **Attack Formalization**: Provided step-by-step algorithm for Liveness Griefing Attack with complexity analysis
3. **Hardened Circuit Specification**: Complete normative specification for in-circuit ciphertext binding (lines 77-116 of Round 1 report)

**Round 3:**
4. **Critical Discovery**: Identified that Hardened PoCE-A is **already in the normative specification** (lines 220-224)
5. **Implementation Guidance**: Provided detailed technical revisions (R1-R5) for final report quality
6. **Quality Validation**: Comprehensive mathematical review confirming correctness of attack algorithms and circuit specification

**Key Contributions Referenced:**
- Appendix [A04.M201](APPENDIX-issue-debates.md#a04-m201) (analysis roadmap)
- Appendix [A04.M201](APPENDIX-issue-debates.md#a04-m201) (formal validation)
- Appendix [A04.M202](APPENDIX-issue-debates.md#a04-m202) (Hardened PoCE-A refinements)
- Appendix [A04.M203](APPENDIX-issue-debates.md#a04-m203) ‚Äî Telescoping lemma for PPE (algebraic identity used in PPE/decapsulation analysis)

M2's work transformed M1's identification into a rigorous mathematical specification with a concrete, implementable solution, and discovered the critical status update.

### 9.3. This Report (Cryptographic Peer Review)

This final report integrates M1 and M2's work with additional adversarial cryptanalysis:

**Novel Contributions:**

   - Security proof sketch under ROM
   - Backend recommendations (Groth16/Plonk/Halo2)
   - Optimization strategies for G_T exponentiation
5. **Prioritized Roadmap**: 3-tier recommendation structure with acceptance criteria and timelines, updated to reflect implementation verification focus
6. **Status Clarification**: Applied M2's critical discovery (R1) to correctly assess the issue as "specification complete, implementation verification required"

## 10. Final Verdict

**Classification:** ‚úÖ **VALIDATED** (Vulnerability identified, normative fix verified in specification, implementation compliance required)

**Severity:** **High** - Would enable deterministic, risk-free, low-cost liveness griefing if implementations deviate from specification

**Resolution Path:**

```
Original State (v1.0):
‚îú‚îÄ PoCE-A proves masks/commitment only (insufficient)
‚îú‚îÄ PoCE-B is decapper-local (delayed verification)
‚îú‚îÄ Status: VULNERABLE to Attack 4.1, 4.2, 4.3
‚îî‚îÄ Action Required: Adopt Hardened PoCE-A

Current State (v2.0 - Normative Specification):
‚îú‚îÄ Hardened PoCE-A specified in lines 220-224 (normative)
‚îú‚îÄ Proves ciphertext correctness in-circuit (C5.1-C5.4)
‚îú‚îÄ Arm-time verification prevents malicious ciphertexts
‚îú‚îÄ Status: CRYPTOGRAPHICALLY SOUND
‚îî‚îÄ Action Required: Verify implementation compliance

Required Verification (Ongoing):
‚îú‚îÄ Audit implementations match specification (C4-C5)
‚îú‚îÄ Test attack prevention (garbage ciphertext fails proof generation)
‚îú‚îÄ Measure performance (overhead within bounds)
‚îî‚îÄ Status: COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION
```

**Blocking Items for Production:**

1. **MUST**: Verify Implementation Compliance (Recommendation 1.1)
   - Timeline: 2-4 weeks
   - Acceptance: Attack 4.1 cryptographically prevented in implementation
   - Deliverable: Audit report confirming constraints C4-C5 are implemented

2. **SHOULD**: Add early T ‚â† O check (Recommendation 2.1)
   - Timeline: 1 week
   - Acceptance: Collusion attack prevented
   - Deliverable: Updated specification with explicit timing requirement

3. **MAY**: Upgrade publication to MUST (Recommendation 3.1)
   - Timeline: 1 week
   - Acceptance: Audit trail available for all spends
   - Deliverable: Normative publication format specification

**Risk Assessment if Implementations Deviate from Specification:**

| Risk Factor | Likelihood | Impact | Severity |
|-------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Implementation missing C4-C5 (Attack 4.1) | Low-Medium | High (liveness break) | **HIGH** |
| Repeated griefing (Attack 4.2) | Low-Medium | Critical (protocol DoS) | **CRITICAL** |
| Multi-armer collusion (Attack 4.3) | Low | Critical (guaranteed failure) | **HIGH** |
| Reputation damage | Medium | High (user trust loss) | **HIGH** |

**Recommended Action:**

**Verify implementation compliance** before production deployment. The normative specification (PVUGC-2025-10-20.md ¬ß5 DEM Construction (Poseidon2 DEM-P2), lines 220-224) is cryptographically sound and includes the Hardened PoCE-A Circuit. The critical requirement is ensuring implementations include:
- Constraint group C4: In-circuit key derivation (`M_i = G_{G16}^{œÅ_i}`, `K_i = Poseidon2(...)`)
- Constraint group C5: In-circuit DEM correctness (`ct_i = pt ‚äï keystream`, `œÑ_i = Poseidon2(...)`)

If implementations deviate from specification by omitting these constraints, the protocol becomes vulnerable to practical, demonstrable attacks that:
- Cost attackers ~seconds of computation
- Cost victims ~minutes-hours of wasted proof generation
- Lock funds until timeout with 100% success rate
- Have zero economic or reputational consequences for attackers

**Current Status:** The cryptographic design is sound. Priority is implementation verification and regression testing to prevent specification divergence.

## 11. Appendix: Formal Security Game

For completeness, we provide a formal security game capturing the Decrypt-on-Proof Soundness property that PoCE-A provides.

**Game: PoCE-Soundness**

```
GAME PoCE-Soundness(Œª):
  // Setup
  pp ‚Üê Setup(1^Œª)                     // Public parameters

  CRS_G16 ‚Üê Groth16.Setup(C, 1^Œª)     // Groth16 CRS for circuit C

  // Derive public bases and target (honest)
  (vk, x) ‚Üê A_1(pp, CRS_GS, CRS_G16)  // Adversary chooses instance
  {U_j} ‚Üê GS.DeriveBases_G2(CRS_GS, x)
  {V_k} ‚Üê GS.DeriveBases_G1(CRS_GS, x)
  G_{G16} ‚Üê Groth16.VerificationProduct(vk, x)
  ctx_hash ‚Üê ContextHash(vk, x, ...)

  // Adversary attempts to break soundness
  (T_i, {D_{1,j}}, {D_{2,k}}, ct_i, œÑ_i, œÄ_PoCE-A) ‚Üê A_2(
    pp, CRS_GS, CRS_G16, {U_j}, {V_k}, G_{G16}, ctx_hash
  )

  // Arm-time check (what honest verifiers do)
  b_arm ‚Üê Verify_PoCE-A(
    œÄ_PoCE-A, T_i, {D_{1,j}}, {D_{2,k}}, ct_i, œÑ_i,
    {U_j}, {V_k}, G_{G16}, ctx_hash, ...
  )

  IF b_arm = FALSE:
    RETURN 0  // Arm-time check caught the attack

  // Adversary wins if there exists a valid proof that cannot decapsulate
  œÄ_G16 ‚Üê A_3(vk, x, ...)  // Adversary produces (possibly invalid) proof
  Att ‚Üê GS.Attest(CRS_GS, vk, x, œÄ_G16)

  IF GS.Verify(CRS_GS, Att, G_{G16}) = FALSE:
    RETURN 0  // Invalid attestation, doesn't count

  // Attempt decapsulation (what honest decapper does)
  M_i ‚Üê Decaps_KEM(Att, {D_{1,j}}, {D_{2,k}})  // Compute pairing product
  K_i ‚Üê KDF(M_i, ctx_hash, ...)
  (s_i', h_i') ‚Üê DEM.Decrypt(K_i, ct_i, œÑ_i)

  IF DEM.Decrypt returned ‚ä•:
    RETURN 1  // Adversary wins: arm-time passed, decap failed

  // Check PoCE-B
  b_decap ‚Üê (T_i == s_i' ¬∑ G) ‚àß (h_i' == H(s_i' || T_i || i))

  IF b_decap = FALSE:
    RETURN 1  // Adversary wins: decryption succeeded but PoCE-B failed

  RETURN 0  // Adversary failed: both arm-time and decap-time checks passed
```

**Security Definition:**

A PoCE scheme is (Œµ, t)-sound if for all PPT adversaries A running in time t:

```
Adv_PoCE-Soundness(A) = Pr[PoCE-Soundness(Œª) = 1] ‚â§ Œµ(Œª)
```

**Theorem (Original PoCE-A):** The original (non-hardened) PoCE-A scheme is **NOT sound** under this definition. There exists an efficient adversary (Attack 4.1) that wins with probability 1.

**Theorem (Hardened PoCE-A):** The Hardened PoCE-A scheme (Section 6, lines 220-224 of specification) **IS sound** under this definition, assuming:
- SNARK soundness (Groth16/Plonk)
- Poseidon2 modeled as random oracle
- Discrete logarithm hardness in (G_1, G_2, G_T)
- GS attestation soundness (binding CRS)
