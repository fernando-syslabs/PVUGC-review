## Executive Summary

**Verdict:** The timing side-channel constitutes a demonstrable violation of the zero-knowledge property, and the absence of normative phase timeouts enables trivial denial-of-service attacks on protocol liveness.

**Impact:** This issue threatens both **security** (information leakage violating zero-knowledge) and **liveness** (protocol deadlock). The severity is **High** because the timing side-channel violates a core cryptographic guarantee, not merely an implementation concern. Without constant-time execution, adversaries can extract approximately 12 bits of witness structure information per timing observation. Without timeout enforcement, a single non-participating armer can deadlock the entire protocol indefinitely.

**Changes from v1.0 ‚Üí v2.0 ‚Üí Peer Review:**
- **v1.0:** Correctly identified three distinct risks: timing side-channels, race conditions, and front-running. Proposed constant-time requirements but lacked formal quantification.
- **v2.0:** Minimal changes. Added optional CSV abort path (SHOULD, not MUST). Generic mention of constant-time operations. Status remained Open and "implementation-dependent".
- **M2 Round 1:** Formalized timing leakage using mutual information framework I(W; T_decap) ‚âà log‚ÇÇ(m‚ÇÅm‚ÇÇ/96). Proposed normative constant-time execution (always 96 pairings) and state machine with mandatory timeouts.
- **Crypto Round 2:** Validated M2's quantification, constructed concrete attack algorithms, formalized race condition deadlock scenarios, and provided spec-ready normative text.
- **M2 Round 3:** Identified critical gaps requiring worst-case analysis, statistical test corrections (TOST), missing invariants, and cache-timing considerations.
- **Final Round 4 (this document):** Incorporates all M2 revisions, achieving mathematical rigor and statistical correctness.

**Remaining Gaps:**
1. Front-running encrypted mempool strategy requires Bitcoin Core v24+ deployment coordination
2. Tie-breaking mechanism for simultaneous timeout expiration may be vulnerable to key-grinding (quantified as negligible: 2^-233 success probability)
3. Cache-timing resistance depends on pairing library constant-time guarantees (requires library-specific validation)

**Required Actions:**
1. **MUST (Spec):** Add ¬ß12.1 (Constant-Time Execution), ¬ß12.2 (State Machine Timeouts), ¬ß12.3 (Front-Running Mitigations) to PVUGC-2025-10-20.md ¬ß1 Introduction
2. **MUST (Spec):** Upgrade optional CSV abort from SHOULD to MUST
3. **MUST (Implementation):** Implement timing invariance tests using TOST methodology with ‚â•10‚Å∂ samples
4. **MUST (Testing):** Validate deadlock prevention under timeout boundary conditions
5. **SHOULD (Deployment):** Select and document front-running mitigation strategy (encrypted mempool or direct miner submission)

## History (v1.0 ‚Üí v2.0 ‚Üí Peer Review)

### v1.0 Original Concern (2025-10-07)
**Document:** [`report-preliminary-2025-10-07/PVUGC-007-timing-attacks.md`](../report-preliminary-2025-10-07/PVUGC-007-timing-attacks.md)

**Key Observations:**
1. **No phase timeouts specified** except optional CSV in abort path
2. **Timing side-channels identified:**
   - Pairing count varies with proof structure (m‚ÇÅ, m‚ÇÇ)
   - DEM decryption success/failure timing differs
   - Cache timing in pairing computation
3. **Front-running window** after signature completion before broadcast
4. **Race conditions** with multiple concurrent decappers

**Proposed Mitigations:**
- Add phase timeouts (T‚ÇÅ arming, T‚ÇÇ presign, T‚ÇÉ-T‚ÇÑ proof window, T‚ÇÖ broadcast)
- Constant-time operations (normative requirements in ¬ß12)
- Front-running mitigations (commit-reveal, encrypted mempool, direct miner submission)

**Status:** Open (Medium severity)

### v2.0 Mitigation Attempt (2025-10-07)
**Document:** [`report-update-2025-10-07/PVUGC-007-timing-race-conditions.md`](../report-update-2025-10-07/PVUGC-007-timing-race-conditions.md)

**Changes Made:**
1. **Optional CSV Abort Path:** SHOULD enable Timeout/Abort with CSV for fund recovery
2. **Generic Constant-Time Mention:** "Use constant-time implementations" (non-normative)
3. **Status Classification:** "Implementation-dependent" ‚Äî delegated to implementers

**What Remained Unaddressed:**
- No state machine for phase transitions
- No explicit timeouts for arming, pre-signing, proof generation
- No normative constant-time requirements (which operations, how to test)
- No race condition resolution mechanism
- No front-running mitigation strategy
- CSV abort remains SHOULD (not MUST)

**Status:** Open (Medium severity, implementation-dependent)

### M2 Round 1 Analysis (2025-10-15)
**Document:** [Appendix A07.M201](APPENDIX-issue-debates.md#a07-m201)

**Key Contributions:**

**1. Formal Timing Side-Channel Quantification:**
- Mutual information framework: I(W; T_decap) ‚âà log‚ÇÇ(m‚ÇÅm‚ÇÇ/96)
- **For small witness sets (m‚ÇÅm‚ÇÇ << 96), leakage can be several bits**
- **Violates zero-knowledge property** (not just implementation concern)

**2. Formal Deadlock Analysis:**
- Scenario: k-1 armers publish, k-th armer never publishes
- Result: Protocol deadlock without timeout
- Trivial DoS attack vector

**3. Normative Mitigations Proposed:**

**Mitigation 1: Constant-Time Execution (¬ß12.1)**
```
MUST perform fixed 96 pairing operations regardless of actual m‚ÇÅ, m‚ÇÇ
Pad with dummy pairings e(G‚ÇÅ_identity, G‚ÇÇ_identity) if needed
DEM decryption MUST be constant-time (no early abort on tag mismatch)
```

**Mitigation 2: State Machine with Timeouts (¬ß12.2)**
```
States: IDLE ‚Üí ARMING ‚Üí PRE_SIGNING ‚Üí AWAITING_PROOF ‚Üí COMPLETED/ABORTED

Timeouts:
- T_ARMING = 24 hours (all k armers must publish)
- T_PRESIG = 1 hour (MuSig2 completion)
- T_PROVING = 10 minutes (proof submission after presig)
- T_BROADCAST = 5 minutes (transaction broadcast after decap)

Failure handling: Transition to ABORTED on timeout expiration
```

## Findings

### Finding 1: Timing Side-Channel Violates Zero-Knowledge Property

**Claim:** The GS-PPE decapsulation loop leaks information about witness structure through timing variation.

**Formal Analysis:**

**Theorem 1 (Timing Leakage Quantification):**
Let W be the random variable representing the prover's witness, and T_decap be the decapsulation time. The mutual information between W and T_decap is:

```
I(W; T_decap) = H(W) - H(W | T_decap)
```

The decapsulation algorithm ([`PVUGC-2025-10-20.md:199`](../PVUGC-2025-10-20.md)) computes:

```
MÃÉ·µ¢ = (‚àè‚±º‚Çå‚ÇÅ^m‚ÇÅ e(C¬π‚±º, D‚ÇÅ,‚±º)) ¬∑ (‚àè‚Çñ‚Çå‚ÇÅ^m‚ÇÇ e(D‚ÇÇ,‚Çñ, C¬≤‚Çñ))
```

where m‚ÇÅ + m‚ÇÇ depends on the GS attestation structure, which correlates with the witness structure.

**Average-Case Leakage Quantification:**

Under the constraint m‚ÇÅ + m‚ÇÇ ‚â§ 96 with m‚ÇÅ, m‚ÇÇ ‚àà {1, 2, ..., 96}, the number of valid (m‚ÇÅ, m‚ÇÇ) pairs is:

```
N = Œ£(s=2 to 96) (s-1) = Œ£(k=1 to 95) k = (95 ¬∑ 96)/2 = 4560
```

**Correction (M2 R3):** The original draft stated 4608 pairs, which is incorrect. The correct count is **4560 pairs**.

If (m‚ÇÅ, m‚ÇÇ) is uniformly distributed over valid pairs:
```
H(m‚ÇÅ, m‚ÇÇ) = log‚ÇÇ(4560) ‚âà 12.16 bits
```

**Timing Precision Assumptions (M2 R2):**

The bound H(m‚ÇÅ, m‚ÇÇ | T_decap) ‚âà 0 holds if adversary timing precision satisfies:

```
Œ¥_time << œÉ_pairing / ‚àöm
```

where:
- Œ¥_time: Adversary measurement precision (e.g., 0.1ms with rdtsc)
- œÉ_pairing: Per-pairing time variance (e.g., 0.05ms for BLS12-381)
- m: Number of pairings (20-96)

**For BLS12-381 with t_pairing ‚âà 1.2ms ¬± 0.05ms:**
- Distinguishable resolution: ~1 pairing
- Required precision: Œ¥_time ‚â§ 0.1ms (achievable with Œºs-level timing)
- Achievable with: CPU cycle counters (rdtsc), high-resolution performance timers

**Realistic Model:**
With Œºs-level timing precision (realistic for network observers), adversaries can distinguish m = m‚ÇÅ + m‚ÇÇ values within resolution ~1 pairing. This means H(m‚ÇÅ, m‚ÇÇ | T_decap) ‚âà 1-2 bits (cannot distinguish every pair, but can distinguish sums m‚ÇÅ+m‚ÇÇ precisely).

**Conservative Leakage Estimate:**
```
I(W; T_decap) ‚âà H(m‚ÇÅ, m‚ÇÇ) - H(m‚ÇÅ, m‚ÇÇ | T_decap)
              ‚âà 12.16 - 1.5
              ‚âà 10-11 bits (average case, Œºs precision)
```

**Worst-Case Leakage Analysis (M2 R1):**

The average-case analysis assumes uniform distribution over (m‚ÇÅ, m‚ÇÇ). For worst-case adversaries:

**Worst-Case Scenario 1: Non-Uniform Witness Distribution**
If witness distribution is non-uniform (e.g., 90% of witnesses map to small (m‚ÇÅ, m‚ÇÇ) values like (20,20) or (30,30)), the effective leakage per observation is:

```
I_worst(W; T_decap) ‚âà log‚ÇÇ(|dominant witness classes|)
```

For example, if only 10 distinct (m‚ÇÅ, m‚ÇÇ) pairs cover 90% of witnesses:
```
I_worst ‚âà log‚ÇÇ(10) ‚âà 3.3 bits per observation
```

But this reveals **which of the 10 common structures** the witness has, potentially narrowing witness search space dramatically.

**Worst-Case Scenario 2: Extreme Small Witness**
For minimal witness with m‚ÇÅ = 1, m‚ÇÇ = 1:
```
Total pairings: m = 2
Timing: t ‚âà 2 ¬∑ 1.2ms = 2.4ms (vs 115.2ms for maximum)
```

If timing reveals m‚ÇÅ = m‚ÇÇ = 1 uniquely, this leaks **exact witness structure** (H = 0 bits remaining about structure). This is a **complete zero-knowledge failure** for extreme cases.

**Worst-Case Scenario 3: Multi-Observation Cumulative Leakage**
If adversary can time multiple related proofs (e.g., different witnesses for related statements):

```
I_cumulative ‚â§ min(n ¬∑ 12, H(W))
```

where n is the number of observations. For H(W) ‚âà 128 bits witness entropy:
- After 11 observations: I_cumulative ‚âà 132 bits (witness fully revealed)
- Conservative bound: O(H(W)/12) ‚âà 11 observations to leak entire witness structure

**Conclusion:** Timing leakage is **between 10-12 bits per observation** (average case, realistic precision) and can be **complete** (H = 0) for extreme small witnesses. Multi-observation attacks can extract full witness in O(11) timing measurements.

**Security Implication:**
The protocol claims zero-knowledge (proves existence without revealing witness details). The timing leak **violates this claim** by revealing:
- Average case: 10-12 bits of structure information per observation
- Worst case: Complete witness structure for extreme cases
- Multi-observation: Full witness extraction in ~11 observations

This is a **demonstrable security failure**, not merely an implementation concern.

### Finding 2: Concrete Timing Attack Algorithms

**Attack 2.1: Witness Structure Inference via Timing Oracle**

**Adversary Model:**
- Passive observer with Œºs-level timing measurement capability
- Can submit multiple valid proofs for the same (vk, x) with different witnesses
- Has access to public GS attestations

**Attack Algorithm:**
```
Algorithm: TIMING_ORACLE_ATTACK
Input: (vk, x), witness space W with |W| = N_witness
Output: Reduced witness candidate set

1. Calibration Phase:
   For each candidate witness w·µ¢ ‚àà sample(W, n_cal):
     a. Generate valid Groth16 proof œÄ·µ¢ for (vk, x, w·µ¢)
     b. Generate GS attestation Att·µ¢ for œÄ·µ¢
     c. Publish Att·µ¢ and observe published attestation
     d. Measure decapsulation time t·µ¢ (10¬≥ samples, median)
     e. Infer (m‚ÇÅ‚Å±, m‚ÇÇ‚Å±) from t·µ¢ using linear regression:
        t·µ¢ ‚âà (m‚ÇÅ‚Å± + m‚ÇÇ‚Å±) ¬∑ t_pairing + t_overhead
        Solve for m = m‚ÇÅ + m‚ÇÇ ‚âà (t·µ¢ - t_overhead) / t_pairing

2. Build correlation map: w·µ¢ ‚Üí (m‚ÇÅ‚Å±, m‚ÇÇ‚Å±)
   Classify witnesses into K ‚â§ 4560 timing classes

3. Target Attack Phase:
   For target attestation Att_target:
     a. Measure t_target (10¬≥ samples, median)
     b. Infer (m‚ÇÅ_target, m‚ÇÇ_target) from timing
     c. Identify timing class C_target
     d. Return W_reduced = {w‚±º | w‚±º ‚àà C_target}

Complexity (M2 R3):
- Pairing operations: O(n_cal ¬∑ 96) where n_cal = calibration sample size
  Typical: n_cal = 100 for statistical significance
- Timing measurements: O(n_cal ¬∑ 10¬≥) samples
- Success probability:
  Let K = number of distinguishable (m‚ÇÅ, m‚ÇÇ) classes (K ‚â§ 4560)
  After timing measurement, witness space reduces from |W| to |W|/K on average

  Expected reduction: |W| / K ‚âà |W| / 4560 for uniform distribution
  Best case (adversary): K = |W| (timing uniquely identifies witness)
  Worst case (adversary): K = 1 (all witnesses have same (m‚ÇÅ, m‚ÇÇ))

**Concrete Example:**
For Bitcoin transaction witness space with |W| ‚âà 2‚Å¥‚Å∞ possible transaction structures uniformly distributed over (m‚ÇÅ, m‚ÇÇ) classes:

Timing measurement reduces search to:
```
|W_reduced| = 2‚Å¥‚Å∞ / 4560 ‚âà 2‚Å¥‚Å∞ / 2¬π¬≤.¬≤
            ‚âà 2¬≤‚Å∑¬∑‚Å∏ candidates
```

This is a **12.2-bit reduction** in witness search space, transforming a 2‚Å¥‚Å∞ brute-force into a 2¬≤‚Å∏ problem (feasible for well-resourced adversaries).
```

**Concrete Example (Bitcoin UTXO structures):**
Suppose the computation validates a Bitcoin transfer:
- w‚ÇÅ: 2 inputs, 2 outputs ‚Üí (m‚ÇÅ = 20, m‚ÇÇ = 20) ‚Üí t‚ÇÅ ‚âà 48ms
- w‚ÇÇ: 10 inputs, 5 outputs ‚Üí (m‚ÇÅ = 45, m‚ÇÇ = 35) ‚Üí t‚ÇÇ ‚âà 96ms

An adversary measuring t_target ‚âà 48ms can infer the witness corresponds to small I/O count, eliminating all high-I/O candidates.

**Cache-Timing Extension (M2 R10):**

**Cache-Timing Attack on Pairing Libraries:**

Modern pairing libraries (blst, arkworks) use precomputed tables for elliptic curve operations. If table lookups depend on input data (commitment coordinates, which correlate with (m‚ÇÅ, m‚ÇÇ)), cache-timing attacks may leak information **even with fixed pairing count**.

**Attack Vector:**
1. **Flush+Reload:** Adversary flushes shared cache lines, triggers decapsulation, measures reload time
2. **Prime+Probe:** Adversary fills cache sets, triggers decapsulation, measures eviction patterns
3. **Cache Access Patterns:** Different (m‚ÇÅ, m‚ÇÇ) may cause different table access sequences

**Leakage Mechanism:**
Even if execution time is constant (96 pairings always), **cache access patterns** may differ:
- (m‚ÇÅ = 48, m‚ÇÇ = 48): Accesses full range of precomputed tables
- (m‚ÇÅ = 20, m‚ÇÇ = 20): Accesses subset of tables (early loop iterations)

If library uses **data-dependent table indexing** without masking, cache timing can leak (m‚ÇÅ, m‚ÇÇ).

**Mitigation (Required):**
Pairing library MUST use:
1. **Cache-oblivious algorithms** (all table entries accessed regardless of data)
2. **Constant-time table lookups** with masking (no data-dependent addressing)
3. **No branch prediction leakage** (no conditional execution based on secret data)

**Recommended Libraries:**
- **blst** (Rust/C): Constant-time by default, explicitly designed for cache resistance
- **arkworks** (Rust): Requires `asm` and `constant_time` feature flags enabled
- **MCL** (C++): Use `MCL_USE_CONSTANT_TIME` compile flag

**Testing:**
- Flush+Reload simulation with performance counters (Intel PT, ARM PMU)
- Verify cache access patterns are uniform across (m‚ÇÅ, m‚ÇÇ) values
- Statistical analysis: cache miss rates should be independent of witness structure

**Conclusion:** Constant-time execution requires **both** timing uniformity **and** cache-access uniformity. Padding to 96 pairings addresses timing but not cache-timing without library guarantees.

**Mitigation (from M2):** Always execute 96 pairings with constant-time, cache-oblivious pairing library.

### Finding 3: Race Condition Formal Analysis

**Claim:** Lack of phase timeouts enables trivial DoS attacks via participant non-participation.

**Formal Deadlock Scenario:**

**Theorem 2 (Arming Phase Deadlock):**
Let k be the number of required armers. The protocol transitions from ARMING ‚Üí PRE_SIGNING only when all k armers have published valid shares.

**Deadlock Condition:**
```
‚àÉi ‚àà [1, k]: Armer·µ¢ never publishes share AND ¬¨‚àÉT_ARMING (timeout)
‚üπ Protocol waits indefinitely in ARMING state
‚üπ All funds locked, zero progress
```

**Attack Algorithm:**
```
Algorithm: ARMING_DOS_ATTACK
Adversary: Controls one of k armers (or causes network partition)

1. Wait for k-1 honest armers to publish shares
2. Refuse to publish own share (or cause network delay)
3. Honest participants wait indefinitely (no timeout specified)
4. Optional: After long delay, publish share to collect any bonded funds

Complexity:
- Adversarial effort: O(1) (simply don't publish)
- Honest party loss: All funds locked until CSV abort (if exists)
- Protocol liveness: Zero (complete deadlock)

Mitigation: Mandatory T_ARMING timeout (24 hours)
```

**Simultaneous Timeout Race Condition:**

**Theorem 3 (Timeout Tie-Breaking Ambiguity):**
If multiple participants independently check timeout expiration, simultaneous transitions can cause state divergence.

**Race Scenario:**
```
Time: T_PRESIG - Œµ (just before timeout)
State: PRE_SIGNING (k participants)

Participant A at time T_PRESIG + Œ¥‚ÇÅ:
  - Checks: current_time > T_PRESIG ‚üπ TRUE
  - Action: Transition to ABORTED, publish abort transaction

Participant B at time T_PRESIG + Œ¥‚ÇÇ:
  - Checks: current_time > T_PRESIG ‚üπ TRUE
  - Action: Transition to ABORTED, publish abort transaction

If Œ¥‚ÇÅ ‚âà Œ¥‚ÇÇ (both check simultaneously):
  - Both publish competing abort transactions
  - Potential: Double-spend if abort outputs differ
  - Mitigation: Tie-breaking mechanism required
```

**Tie-Breaking Mechanism (M2 R7 Enhancement):**

**Proposed Rule: Lexicographic Ordering on Public Keys**
```
Priority: smallest participant public key (compressed encoding)
Winner: participant with min(P‚ÇÅ, P‚ÇÇ, ..., P‚Çñ) publishes abort
Losers: wait grace period (30 seconds), observe winner's transaction
```

**Key-Grinding Attack Analysis (M2 E1):**

Lexicographic ordering creates strategic advantage for participants with small public keys.

**Attack:**
An adversary could:
1. Generate 2^b key pairs offline
2. Select the lexicographically smallest key
3. Gain systematic advantage in timeout races

**Quantification:**
For k participants, the probability that an adversary with public key P_adv wins is:
```
Pr[adv wins] = Pr[P_adv < min(P_honest,1, ..., P_honest,k-1)]
```

If adversary grinds 2^b key pairs, the smallest key is expected to be in the bottom 2^(-b) fraction of keyspace (secp256k1: 256-bit keys).

For b = 20 (1 million keys tried):
```
Pr[adv wins] ‚âà 1 - (1 - 2^(-256))^(2^20)
             ‚âà 2^20 ¬∑ 2^(-256)  (Poisson approximation)
             ‚âà 2^(-236)
```

For k = 5 participants (adversary needs to beat 4 honest keys):
```
Pr[adv wins] ‚âà k ¬∑ 2^20 ¬∑ 2^(-256)
             ‚âà 5 ¬∑ 2^(-236)
             ‚âà 2^(-233.7)
```

**Conclusion:** Attack requires 2^20 key generations (feasible) but has **negligible success probability** (2^(-233)). Lexicographic ordering is acceptable for timeout tie-breaking given astronomical failure probability.

**More Robust Alternative (Optional):**
Use context-bound priority to prevent key grinding:
```
priority_i = H("PVUGC/TIMEOUT_PRIORITY" || ctx_hash || P_i || timeout_type)
Smallest priority_i wins
```

This prevents grinding because ctx_hash is unknown at key selection time. However, given the negligible attack probability, this optimization is **optional**.

**Recommendation:** Use lexicographic ordering (simpler) with documented negligible attack probability. Deployments requiring defense-in-depth MAY use context-bound priority.

### Finding 4: Front-Running Vulnerability Analysis

**Claim:** Mempool observation enables value extraction via transaction replacement.

**Attack 4.1: Mempool Front-Running**

**Adversary Model:**
- Monitors Bitcoin public mempool with low-latency connection to miners
- Can extract signature from observed transaction
- Can build and broadcast replacement transaction with higher fee

**Attack Algorithm:**
```
Algorithm: MEMPOOL_FRONTRUN_ATTACK
Adversary: Monitors mempool with low-latency connection to miners

1. Monitor mempool for PVUGC transactions (identify by scriptPubKey pattern)
2. Upon observing tx_honest:
   a. Extract signature s from witness
   b. Extract sighash m from transaction template
   c. Verify: s¬∑G - e¬∑P = R (signature is valid)

3. Analyze transaction flexibility:
   a. Check if CPFP anchor output is present
   b. Check if any outputs are malleable
   c. Estimate value extractable via fee manipulation

4. If profitable:
   a. Attempt to build tx_attack with modified parameters
   b. Broadcast tx_attack with higher fee
```

**Critical Observation:**
The spec (PVUGC-2025-10-20.md ¬ß1 Introduction) states:
```
"Transaction binding: all signatures use SIGHASH_ALL, bind tapleaf hash and version"
```

This **strongly mitigates** front-running because SIGHASH_ALL commits to all outputs.

**CPFP and RBF Analysis (M2 R8):**

**CPFP (Child-Pays-For-Parent) Attack:**

The spec includes a "small P2TR CPFP hook output" (line 50) but does not specify spending conditions.

**Scenario A: Anchor controlled by signing key P**
- Adversary **cannot** spend anchor (requires valid signature from P)
- CPFP is **NOT an attack vector**
- Fee manipulation requires consent of key holders

**Scenario B: Anchor is "anyone-can-spend" (e.g., OP_TRUE scriptPubKey)**
- Adversary **CAN** spend anchor in child transaction
- **Low-fee child attack:** Adversary creates child with minimal fee, delaying parent confirmation (griefing)
- **High-fee child attack:** Adversary accelerates parent confirmation

**Analysis of High-Fee CPFP:**
Even if adversary accelerates parent confirmation via CPFP:
- Parent transaction outputs are fixed by SIGHASH_ALL (adversary cannot modify)
- Adversary gains no value from accelerating honest transaction
- **Conclusion:** High-fee CPFP is not an attack (only benefits honest parties)

**Analysis of Low-Fee CPFP (Griefing):**
Adversary creates child spending anchor with fee below minimum relay fee:
- Delays parent confirmation (keeps it in mempool longer)
- Does not extract value but harms honest parties (denial-of-service)

**Mitigation (MUST):**
If anchor is anyone-can-spend:
1. **Add minimum fee requirement** to anchor spend (e.g., OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY delay)
2. **Monitor mempool for CPFP attempts** and alert on anomalous child transactions
3. **Preferred:** Make anchor spending require signature from P (Scenario A)

**Recommended Spec Clarification:**
```
CPFP hook output MUST be controlled by aggregate public key P
(requires signature from pre-signing participants)
This prevents adversarial CPFP griefing while preserving fee-bumping capability
```

**RBF (Replace-By-Fee) Attack:**

BIP-125 allows replacing unconfirmed transactions with higher-fee versions (opt-in RBF flag).

**Attack Attempt:**
Adversary observes tx_honest in mempool, attempts to create tx_replace with:
- Same inputs (same UTXO spend)
- Different outputs (redirect value to adversary)
- Higher fee (to incentivize miner inclusion)
- **Challenge:** Must produce valid signature for modified transaction

**Why RBF Attack FAILS:**
```
SIGHASH_ALL commits to:
- All transaction inputs
- All transaction outputs
- locktime, version, etc.

Modified transaction has sighash m' ‚â† m (different outputs)
Signature s = s' + Œ± is valid ONLY for original sighash m
Adversary cannot produce valid signature for m' without knowledge of:
- Œ± (witness-encrypted)
- Private key for P (unknown)

Conclusion: RBF attack FAILS under SIGHASH_ALL
```

**Mitigation (Already Satisfied):**
Transaction template MUST use SIGHASH_ALL (required by spec line 49). RBF is **not an attack vector** given this requirement.

**Additional Safety (SHOULD):**
- **Disable RBF flag** (BIP-125 opt-out): Set sequence to 0xfffffffe (signals "no RBF")
- **Monitor mempool** for RBF attempts (should not occur, but detect anomalies)

**Residual Front-Running Vectors:**

Despite SIGHASH_ALL:
1. **Mempool observation:** Adversaries can analyze transaction patterns, timing, and fees (information leakage)
2. **Miner collusion:** Miners can preferentially order transactions (MEV extraction at miner level)

**Mitigation Strategy 1: Encrypted Mempool (RECOMMENDED)**

Bitcoin Core v24+ supports encrypted P2P transport (BIP-324):
```
Implementation:
1. Enable encrypted P2P: --v2transport=1 in Bitcoin Core config
2. Connect only to peers supporting BIP-324
3. Broadcast transaction via encrypted channels

Limitations:
- Miners must also support encrypted transport
- Does not prevent miner-level front-running (miners see all transactions)

Effectiveness: Medium (reduces passive observation, not active attacks)
```

**Mitigation Strategy 2: Direct Miner Submission (ALTERNATIVE)**

Submit transactions directly to mining pools via private channels:
```
Implementation:
1. Establish relationship with mining pool(s)
2. Submit transaction via pool's private API (bypass public mempool)
3. Pool includes transaction in next block

Limitations:
- Requires trust in mining pool
- Reduces decentralization (not publicly visible until confirmation)
- Pool could extract MEV directly

Effectiveness: High (eliminates mempool observation) but introduces trust assumptions
```

**Recommendation:** Tier 1 (MUST): SIGHASH_ALL + no RBF + controlled CPFP anchor. Tier 2 (RECOMMENDED): Encrypted mempool for defense-in-depth.

### Finding 5: Constant-Time Execution Formal Requirements

**Current Spec Gap:**
PVUGC-2025-10-20.md ¬ß1 Introduction mentions constant-time informally (lines 146-147) but lacks MUST requirements.

**Formalization:**

**Definition (Œµ-Constant-Time Operation):**
An operation f(x) is Œµ-constant-time if for all inputs x, y and all timing measurements t:
```
|Pr[Time(f(x)) = t] - Pr[Time(f(y)) = t]| ‚â§ Œµ
```

For cryptographic applications, Œµ should be negligible.

**Threshold Justification (M2 R5):**

The Œµ thresholds must ensure distinguishing requires computationally infeasible sample sizes.

**Statistical Distinguishing Theory:**
For Œµ-closeness of timing distributions, statistical distinguishing requires:
```
q ‚âà O(1/Œµ¬≤) samples (Chernoff bound)
```

**GS-PPE Decapsulation (Œµ < 2^(-40)):**
```
Required samples: q ‚âà (1/Œµ)¬≤ = (2^40)¬≤ = 2^80
At 100ms per decapsulation: Time = 2^80 ¬∑ 100ms ‚âà 3.8 √ó 10^16 years

Conclusion: 2^(-40) ensures distinguishing is computationally infeasible
```

This threshold is appropriate for **CI/CD testing** where:
- Tests run on varied hardware (some variance expected)
- Goal: Detect **gross timing leaks** (>1Œºs variance for 100ms operation)
- False positive rate: ~2^(-40) ‚âà 10^(-12) per test (acceptable for automated testing)

**Practical Interpretation:**
Œµ = 2^(-40) for 100ms operation ‚üπ allowable variance ~0.09Œºs (extremely tight)
This is overly conservative. More practical: Œµ = 2^(-20) for CI/CD (1Œºs variance), Œµ = 2^(-40) for production validation.

**DEM Decryption (Œµ < 2^(-60)):**
```
Required samples: q ‚âà 2^120
At 1Œºs per decryption: Time = 2^120 ¬∑ 1Œºs ‚âà 4.2 √ó 10^22 years

Conclusion: 2^(-60) ensures distinguishing is infeasible even for fast operations
```

This threshold is appropriate for **production deployment** where:
- DEM operations are fast (~1Œºs), adversaries can sample many times
- Goal: Cryptographic-grade indistinguishability
- Aligns with NIST SP 800-90B min-entropy requirements (2^(-60) collision resistance)

**Threshold Selection Rule:**
```
Œµ < 2^(-Œª/2) where Œª = security parameter

For Œª = 80 (80-bit security): Œµ < 2^(-40)
For Œª = 128 (128-bit security): Œµ < 2^(-64)
```

**Practical Recommendation:**
- **CI/CD testing:** Œµ < 2^(-20) (1Œºs variance, detects gross leaks)
- **Production validation:** Œµ < 2^(-40) (balances false positives vs security)
- **Cryptographic-grade:** Œµ < 2^(-60) (NIST-compliant, for fast operations)

**Operations Requiring Constant-Time Execution:**

**1. GS-PPE Decapsulation Loop (line 168-173):**
```
MUST execute exactly 96 pairing operations
If m‚ÇÅ + m‚ÇÇ < 96, pad with e(G‚ÇÅ_id, G‚ÇÇ_id)
Target: Œµ < 2^(-40) for production (variance < 0.1Œºs for ~100ms operation)
```

**2. DEM Decryption (line 159):**
```
MUST complete all steps regardless of tag verification success
No early abort on authentication failure
Target: Œµ < 2^(-60) (cryptographic-grade for fast operations)
```

**3. PoCE-B Verification (line 173):**
```
MUST verify all k shares (no early abort on first failure)
Point comparison T·µ¢ ?= s·µ¢¬∑G must be constant-time
Target: Œµ < 2^(-60)
```

**Testing Requirements (M2 R6 - CRITICAL CORRECTION):**

**INCORRECT (Original Draft):**
```
Welch's t-test with p > 0.01 to accept null hypothesis
```

**Problem:** Using p > 0.01 as acceptance criterion is statistically incorrect. Failing to reject H‚ÇÄ does **not prove** H‚ÇÄ is true (absence of evidence ‚â† evidence of absence).

**CORRECT: Two One-Sided Tests (TOST) for Equivalence**

**Statistical Framework:**
- **Null Hypothesis H‚ÇÄ:** Timing distributions differ by more than Œµ (NOT constant-time)
- **Alternative H‚ÇÅ:** Timing distributions are Œµ-equivalent (constant-time)

**TOST Procedure:**
```
1. Define equivalence margin: Œî = Œµ ¬∑ mean(Time_A)
   Example: For 100ms operation, Œµ = 2^(-40), Œî = 100ms ¬∑ 2^(-40) ‚âà 0.09Œºs

2. Collect timing samples:
   - Distribution A: n ‚â• 10^6 samples (e.g., m‚ÇÅ=20, m‚ÇÇ=20)
   - Distribution B: n ‚â• 10^6 samples (e.g., m‚ÇÅ=48, m‚ÇÇ=48)

3. Compute mean difference: ŒîŒº = mean(Time_A) - mean(Time_B)
   Compute standard errors: SE_A, SE_B
   Compute pooled SE: SE_pooled = ‚àö(SE_A¬≤ + SE_B¬≤)

4. Test two one-sided hypotheses:
   H‚ÇÄ‚ÇÅ: ŒîŒº ‚â• Œî  (upper bound violation)
   H‚ÇÄ‚ÇÇ: ŒîŒº ‚â§ -Œî (lower bound violation)

   t‚ÇÅ = (ŒîŒº - Œî) / SE_pooled
   t‚ÇÇ = (ŒîŒº + Œî) / SE_pooled

   p‚ÇÅ = CDF_t(t‚ÇÅ, df)
   p‚ÇÇ = 1 - CDF_t(t‚ÇÇ, df)

5. Decision rule:
   If p‚ÇÅ < Œ± AND p‚ÇÇ < Œ± (both tests reject): Accept H‚ÇÅ (Œµ-equivalent)
   Otherwise: Reject (timing leak detected)

   Standard: Œ± = 0.05 (95% confidence)
   Conservative: Œ± = 0.01 (99% confidence)
```

**Implementation Example:**
```python
from scipy import stats
import numpy as np

def tost_equivalence_test(times_a, times_b, epsilon=2**(-40), alpha=0.05):
    """
    Two One-Sided Tests (TOST) for timing equivalence.

    Args:
        times_a: Timing samples for condition A (array)
        times_b: Timing samples for condition B (array)
        epsilon: Equivalence margin (relative)
        alpha: Significance level (0.05 = 95% confidence)

    Returns:
        (equivalent, p_value_max, delta_mu)
    """
    mean_a = np.mean(times_a)
    mean_b = np.mean(times_b)
    delta_mu = mean_a - mean_b

    # Equivalence margin (absolute)
    delta = epsilon * max(mean_a, mean_b)

    # Standard errors
    se_a = stats.sem(times_a)
    se_b = stats.sem(times_b)
    se_pooled = np.sqrt(se_a**2 + se_b**2)

    # Degrees of freedom (Welch-Satterthwaite)
    df = len(times_a) + len(times_b) - 2

    # Two one-sided t-tests
    t1 = (delta_mu - delta) / se_pooled  # Upper bound test
    t2 = (delta_mu + delta) / se_pooled  # Lower bound test

    p1 = stats.t.cdf(t1, df)
    p2 = 1 - stats.t.cdf(t2, df)

    # Both tests must reject (p < alpha) to accept equivalence
    equivalent = (p1 < alpha) and (p2 < alpha)
    p_value_max = max(p1, p2)

    return equivalent, p_value_max, delta_mu

# Example usage
times_min = measure_decap_timing(m1=20, m2=20, samples=10**6)
times_max = measure_decap_timing(m1=48, m2=48, samples=10**6)

equiv, p_val, diff = tost_equivalence_test(times_min, times_max, epsilon=2**(-40))

if equiv:
    print(f"‚úì Constant-time validated (p={p_val:.6f}, ŒîŒº={diff*1e6:.3f}Œºs)")
else:
    print(f"‚úó Timing leak detected (p={p_val:.6f}, ŒîŒº={diff*1e6:.3f}Œºs)")
```

**Minimum Sample Size:**
For detecting Œµ = 2^(-40) with 95% confidence:
```
n ‚â• 2 ¬∑ (z_Œ±/2 / Œµ)¬≤ ‚âà 2 ¬∑ (1.96 / 2^(-40))¬≤ ‚âà 10^25 (infeasible)
```

**Practical Approach:**
Use **wider equivalence bounds** for testing:
```
CI/CD: Œî = 2œÉ_noise (noise-level equivalence, Œµ_practical ‚âà 2^(-20))
Production: Œî = 1Œºs (absolute bound, easier to verify)
Cryptographic: Rely on library guarantees + statistical spot-checks
```

**Validation Checklist:**
```
Test 1: GS-PPE Decapsulation Timing Uniformity
- Inputs: (m‚ÇÅ=20, m‚ÇÇ=20), (m‚ÇÅ=48, m‚ÇÇ=48), (m‚ÇÅ=10, m‚ÇÇ=10)
- Samples: 10‚Å∂ per input
- Method: TOST with equivalence bounds ¬±2œÉ_noise

- Samples: 10‚Åµ per input (slower operation)
- Method: TOST with equivalence bounds ¬±10Œºs
- Accept if: Both one-sided tests p < 0.05
```

### Finding 6: State Machine Formal Specification

**Current Spec Gap:**
No formal state machine for protocol phases. Implicit ordering from narrative.

**Proposed Formal State Machine:**

**States:**
```
S = {IDLE, ARMING, PRE_SIGNING, AWAITING_PROOF, DECAP, BROADCAST, COMPLETED, ABORTED}
```

**State Transition Function:**
```
Œ¥: S √ó Event ‚Üí S

Events:
- InitContext: IDLE ‚Üí ARMING
- AllArmersPublished: ARMING ‚Üí PRE_SIGNING (if within T_ARMING)
- Arming_Timeout: ARMING ‚Üí ABORTED (if timeout expired)
- PreSigComplete: PRE_SIGNING ‚Üí AWAITING_PROOF (if valid s', R within T_PRESIG)
- PreSig_Timeout: PRE_SIGNING ‚Üí ABORTED
- ProofReceived: AWAITING_PROOF ‚Üí DECAP (if valid attestation)
- Proof_Timeout: AWAITING_PROOF ‚Üí ABORTED (after CSV Œî)
- DecapComplete: DECAP ‚Üí BROADCAST (if valid Œ±, s)
- Decap_Timeout: DECAP ‚Üí ABORTED
- BroadcastComplete: BROADCAST ‚Üí COMPLETED
- Broadcast_Timeout: BROADCAST ‚Üí ABORTED
```

**State Invariants (M2 R4 - CRITICAL ADDITION):**

The original draft specified timeout-related invariants but **omitted critical safety properties** defined in ¬ß12.2.5. For completeness and consistency, all invariants are consolidated here:

**Invariant I1 (Mutual Exclusion):**
```
‚àÄt: |{s ‚àà S : state(t) = s}| = 1
```
At any time t, exactly one state s ‚àà S is active (no state ambiguity).

**Invariant I2 (Monotonic Progress):**
```
States are partially ordered:
IDLE < ARMING < PRE_SIGNING < AWAITING_PROOF < DECAP < BROADCAST < COMPLETED

‚àÄt‚ÇÅ < t‚ÇÇ: state(t‚ÇÅ) ‚â§ state(t‚ÇÇ) ‚à® state(t‚ÇÇ) = ABORTED
```
Transitions MUST be monotonically increasing except to ABORTED.

**Invariant I3 (Timeout Enforcement):**
```
‚àÄs ‚àà {ARMING, PRE_SIGNING, AWAITING_PROOF, DECAP, BROADCAST}:
  elapsed_time(s) > T_s ‚üπ ‚óá(state = ABORTED)
```
Eventually, timeout triggers abortion (liveness property, using temporal logic ‚óá = "eventually").

**Invariant I4 (Abort Finality):**
```
state = ABORTED ‚üπ ‚ñ°(state = ABORTED)
```
Once aborted, state never changes (terminal state, using temporal logic ‚ñ° = "always").

**Timeout-Specific Invariants:**

```
I_ARMING: |{published armers}| ‚â§ k ‚àß elapsed_time ‚â§ T_ARMING
I_PRE_SIGNING: ‚àÉ(s', R) valid ‚à® elapsed_time ‚â§ T_PRESIG
I_AWAITING_PROOF: ‚àÉ Att valid ‚à® elapsed_time ‚â§ Œî_CSV
I_DECAP: ‚àÉŒ± = Œ£·µ¢ s·µ¢ ‚àß s = s' + Œ± ‚àß elapsed_time ‚â§ T_DECAP
I_BROADCAST: tx broadcasted ‚àß elapsed_time ‚â§ T_BROADCAST
```

**Timeout Parameters (from M2, validated):**
```
T_ARMING = 24 hours (conservative for multi-party coordination)
T_PRESIG = 1 hour (MuSig2 typically completes in seconds)
Œî_CSV = 48 hours (proof generation fallback, specified in Bitcoin script)
T_DECAP = 10 minutes (decapsulation ~100ms, allowing retry buffer)
T_BROADCAST = 5 minutes (Bitcoin propagation ~seconds)
```

**Validation:** These timeout values are reasonable for a multi-party protocol over public networks. Implementations MAY use longer timeouts but MUST NOT use shorter values without formal analysis justifying the reduction.

---

### Finding 7: Severity Upgrade Justification

**Current Classification:** Medium (v1.0, v2.0)

**Proposed Upgrade:** High

**Rationale:**

**Medium Severity Criteria:**
- Affects liveness but not soundness
- Implementation-dependent issue
- Workaround available

**High Severity Criteria:**
- Violates core cryptographic property (zero-knowledge)
- Protocol-level vulnerability (not implementation-specific)
- No workaround without spec changes

**Analysis:**

**1. Violates Zero-Knowledge Property:**
   - The protocol claims proof existence without revealing witness details
   - Timing leak reveals 10-12 bits of witness structure per observation (Finding 1)
   - Multi-observation attacks can extract full witness in ~11 observations
   - This is a **security failure**, not just liveness concern

**2. Protocol-Level Vulnerability:**
   - Deadlock attack (Finding 3) requires only non-participation (O(1) effort)
   - No implementation choice can prevent deadlock without timeout specification
   - This is a **protocol design flaw**, not implementation bug

**3. No Workaround Without Spec Changes:**
   - Constant-time execution requires normative specification (which operations, how to test)
   - Timeout enforcement requires protocol-level state machine
   - Implementers cannot unilaterally fix without spec guidance

**Conclusion:** Severity upgrade to **High** is justified.

---

## Recommendations

### Normative Requirements (MUST/SHOULD for Specification)

#### Recommendation 1: Add ¬ß12.1 - Constant-Time Execution (MUST)

**Add to PVUGC-2025-10-20.md ¬ß1 Introduction after current ¬ß11:**

```markdown
### 12.1 Constant-Time Execution (Normative)

To prevent side-channel leakage of witness-related information, implementations of the PVUGC protocol MUST adhere to the following constant-time requirements:

#### 12.1.1 GS-PPE Decapsulation Loop

The computation of the product-of-pairings during decapsulation (¬ß6, Eq. GS-PPE) MUST take a fixed amount of time independent of the number of commitments (m‚ÇÅ, m‚ÇÇ) in the GS attestation.

**MUST Requirements:**
1. **Fixed Pairing Count:** Implementations MUST perform exactly 96 pairing operations, regardless of the actual values of m‚ÇÅ and m‚ÇÇ.

2. **Dummy Pairing Padding:** If an attestation uses fewer than 96 pairings (m‚ÇÅ + m‚ÇÇ < 96), the remaining iterations MUST be filled with dummy pairing operations:
   ```
   For j = m‚ÇÅ+1 to 96:
       e(G‚ÇÅ_identity, G‚ÇÇ_identity)  // Dummy pairing
   ```
   The results of dummy pairings MUST be computed but not used in the final product.

3. **No Early Termination:** The loop MUST NOT terminate early upon detecting invalid commitments. All 96 iterations MUST complete before returning success or failure.

4. **Constant-Time Pairing Library:** Implementations MUST use a pairing library that provides constant-time guarantees:
   - **blst** (Rust/C): Enable default constant-time mode, verify with timing tests
   - **arkworks** (Rust): Enable `asm` and `constant_time` feature flags
   - **MCL** (C++): Use `MCL_USE_CONSTANT_TIME` compile flag
   - **Other:** Consult library documentation for constant-time guarantees

**Rationale:** The number of pairings m = m‚ÇÅ + m‚ÇÇ can reveal 10-12 bits of witness structure information per observation. Fixed-time execution eliminates this side-channel.

#### 12.1.2 DEM Decryption and Verification

The process of decrypting the ciphertext ct·µ¢ and verifying the authentication tag œÑ·µ¢ MUST be constant-time.

**MUST Requirements:**
1. **Complete Decryption:** The decryption algorithm MUST perform all computational steps regardless of intermediate validation results.

2. **No Early Abort:** The algorithm MUST NOT exit early upon detecting tag mismatch, padding errors, or malformed ciphertext. All steps (KDF, keystream generation, XOR, tag computation) MUST complete.

3. **Constant-Time Comparison:** Tag verification MUST use constant-time comparison:
   ```
   // Correct (constant-time):
   result = constant_time_compare(œÑ·µ¢_computed, œÑ·µ¢_received)

   // Incorrect (timing leak):
   if (œÑ·µ¢_computed == œÑ·µ¢_received) { ... }
   ```

4. **Uniform Return Timing:** Success and failure paths MUST take the same amount of time (within measurement error Œµ < 2^(-60)).

**Rationale:** Timing differences between successful and failed decryption can reveal which ciphertexts correspond to valid proofs, creating an oracle for proof validity testing.

#### 12.1.3 PoCE-B Verification

Verification of Proof-of-Correct-Encryption (PoCE-B) MUST be performed in constant time.

**MUST Requirements:**
1. **Verify All Shares:** Implementations MUST verify all k armer shares, even if earlier shares fail validation.

2. **Constant-Time Point Operations:** Point multiplication (T·µ¢ ?= s·µ¢¬∑G) and comparison MUST use constant-time implementations.

3. **Deferred Failure Reporting:** Validation failures MUST be accumulated (e.g., in a bitmask) and reported only after all k shares have been checked.

**Rationale:** Timing variations during PoCE-B verification can reveal which armers produced valid vs invalid shares, enabling correlation attacks in threshold settings.

#### 12.1.4 Cache-Timing Considerations (MUST)

Modern pairing libraries use precomputed tables for elliptic curve operations. If table lookups depend on input data (m‚ÇÅ, m‚ÇÇ, commitment values), cache-timing attacks may leak information even with fixed pairing count.

**MUST Requirements:**

1. **Cache-Oblivious Algorithms:** Pairing library MUST use cache-oblivious algorithms or constant-time table lookups.

2. **Library Validation:** Implementations MUST verify pairing library provides:
   - Constant-time field operations (blst: default, arkworks: requires feature flag)
   - Masked table lookups (no data-dependent addressing)
   - No branch prediction leakage (no conditional execution based on secret data)

3. **Testing:** Cache-timing tests SHOULD be performed using:
   - Flush+Reload attacks (simulated)
   - Prime+Probe attacks (simulated)
   - Performance counter monitoring (Intel PT, ARM PMU)

**Recommended Libraries:**
- **blst** (Rust/C): Constant-time by default, battle-tested, explicitly designed for cache resistance
- **arkworks** (Rust): Enable `asm` and `constant_time` features
- **MCL** (C++): Use `MCL_USE_CONSTANT_TIME` flag

**Documentation:** Implementations MUST document cache-timing resistance validation methodology and results.

**Rationale:** Padding to 96 pairings prevents timing leaks but may not prevent cache-timing leaks if library uses data-dependent table lookups.

#### 12.1.5 Testing and Validation

Implementations claiming constant-time execution MUST provide evidence via:

**1. Statistical Timing Tests (TOST Methodology):**
   - **Method:** Two One-Sided Tests (TOST) for equivalence
   - **Null Hypothesis H‚ÇÄ:** Timing distributions differ by more than Œµ
   - **Alternative H‚ÇÅ:** Timing distributions are Œµ-equivalent (constant-time)
   - **Procedure:**
     1. Collect samples: n ‚â• 10‚Å∂ per distribution
     2. Define equivalence bounds: ¬±2œÉ_noise (CI/CD) or ¬±1Œºs (production)
     3. Compute two one-sided t-tests:
        - H‚ÇÄ‚ÇÅ: ŒîŒº ‚â• Œµ (upper bound)
        - H‚ÇÄ‚ÇÇ: ŒîŒº ‚â§ -Œµ (lower bound)
     4. Reject both at Œ± = 0.05 level to accept Œµ-equivalence
   - **Implementation:** Use TOST libraries (Python: statsmodels, R: TOSTER)

**2. Test Vectors:**
   ```
   Test 1: GS-PPE Decapsulation
   - Input A: Attestation with m‚ÇÅ=20, m‚ÇÇ=20 (40 pairings)
   - Input B: Attestation with m‚ÇÅ=48, m‚ÇÇ=48 (96 pairings)
   - Measure: 10‚Å∂ timing samples for each
   - Verify: TOST with equivalence bounds ¬±2œÉ_noise, both p < 0.05

   Test 2: DEM Decryption
   - Input A: Valid ciphertext (correct tag)
   - Input B: Invalid ciphertext (incorrect tag)
   - Measure: 10‚Å∂ timing samples for each
   - Verify: TOST with equivalence bounds ¬±1Œºs, both p < 0.05

   Test 3: PoCE-B Verification
   - Input A: All k shares valid
   - Input B: One share invalid (rest valid)
   - Measure: 10‚Åµ timing samples for each
   - Verify: TOST with equivalence bounds ¬±10Œºs, both p < 0.05
   ```

**3. CI/CD Integration:** Timing tests MUST be part of continuous integration and fail the build if timing leaks are detected (TOST rejects equivalence).

**SHOULD Requirements:**
1. Implementations SHOULD use hardware-based constant-time primitives where available (e.g., AES-NI for DEM).
2. Implementations SHOULD disable CPU frequency scaling during timing-sensitive operations.
3. Implementations SHOULD document any residual timing variance (quantified in microseconds).
```

#### Recommendation 2: Add ¬ß12.2 - Protocol State Machine with Timeouts (MUST)

**Add to PVUGC-2025-10-20.md ¬ß1 Introduction after ¬ß12.1:**

```markdown
### 12.2 Protocol State Machine with Timeouts (Normative)

To ensure protocol liveness and prevent denial-of-service attacks, implementations MUST enforce a formal state machine with mandatory timeouts for all phases.

#### 12.2.1 State Definitions

The protocol lifecycle consists of the following states:

1. **IDLE:** Initial state before context initialization
2. **ARMING:** Collecting armer shares (¬ß5)
3. **PRE_SIGNING:** MuSig2 adaptor pre-signature generation (¬ß4)
4. **AWAITING_PROOF:** Waiting for valid Groth16+GS proof
5. **DECAP:** Decapsulation and signature finalization (¬ß6)
6. **BROADCAST:** Transaction broadcast to Bitcoin network
7. **COMPLETED:** Terminal success state (transaction confirmed)
8. **ABORTED:** Terminal failure state (timeout or validation failure)

#### 12.2.2 State Transitions and Timeouts

**Transition 1: IDLE ‚Üí ARMING**
- **Trigger:** Protocol context initialization (vk, x, txid_template, ctx_hash computed)
- **Timeout:** None (instantaneous)

#### 12.2.3 Timeout Parameter Values (Normative)

Implementations MUST use the following minimum timeout values:

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| T_ARMING | 24 hours | Multi-party coordination over asynchronous networks |
| T_PRESIG | 1 hour | MuSig2 typically completes in seconds; 1h allows retries |
| Œî_CSV | 48 hours | Groth16 proving time varies; allows resource-constrained provers |
| T_DECAP | 10 minutes | Decapsulation ~100ms; 10min allows multiple retry attempts |
| T_BROADCAST | 5 minutes | Bitcoin propagation ~seconds; 5min allows network congestion |

Implementations MAY use longer timeouts but MUST NOT use shorter values without formal analysis justifying the reduction.

#### 12.2.4 Simultaneous Timeout Resolution (Tie-Breaking)

If multiple participants independently detect timeout expiration within a narrow time window (e.g., clock skew ‚â§1s), the following tie-breaking rules MUST apply:

**Rule 1: Deterministic Ordering**
- Participants MUST use a deterministic tie-breaking mechanism based on public identifiers
- **Specification:** Smallest participant public key (lexicographic order on compressed encoding)
- **Alternative (more robust):** Context-bound priority:
  ```
  priority_i = H("PVUGC/TIMEOUT_PRIORITY" || ctx_hash || P_i || timeout_type)
  Smallest priority_i wins
  ```
  This prevents key-grinding attacks (adversary cannot pre-select advantageous key).

**Security Note (Key-Grinding Attack):**

Deterministic lexicographic ordering creates a strategic advantage for participants who can grind public keys. An adversary generating 2^b key pairs can select the lexicographically smallest key, gaining advantage:

```
Pr[adv wins] ‚âà 1 - (1 - 2^(-256))^(2^b) ‚âà 2^b ¬∑ 2^(-256)
```

For k = 5 participants and b = 2^20 (1 million keys):
```
Pr[adv wins] ‚âà 2^20 ¬∑ 5 ¬∑ 2^(-256) ‚âà 2^(-233.7)
```

**Conclusion:** Attack is computationally expensive (2^20 key generations) with negligible success probability (2^(-233)). Lexicographic ordering is acceptable for timeout tie-breaking.

**Alternative (More Robust):** Use context-bound priority:
```
priority_i = H("PVUGC/TIMEOUT_PRIORITY" || ctx_hash || P_i || timeout_type)
Smallest priority_i wins
```
This prevents key grinding since ctx_hash is unknown at key selection time.

**Rule 2: First-Seen-First-Valid**
- In case of competing timeout transactions, the first transaction seen by the Bitcoin network is considered valid
- Losing participants MUST NOT attempt to override with higher fees (to prevent DoS escalation)

**Rule 3: Grace Period**
- Participants SHOULD wait a grace period (e.g., 30 seconds) after timeout expiration before publishing abort transactions
- This reduces the probability of simultaneous publications

**Rule 4: Clock Source**
- Timeout expiration MUST be checked against blockchain median-time-past (BIP-113) or NTP-synchronized time with maximum clock skew ‚â§ 1 second
- Local system clocks MAY have skew up to ¬±70 minutes (per BIP-113), which is unacceptable
- **Recommended:** Use Bitcoin blockchain timestamps for timeout checks (robust to clock skew)

#### 12.2.5 State Invariants (Normative Assertions)

Implementations MUST maintain the following invariants:

**Invariant I1 (Single Active State):**
```
At any time t, exactly one state s ‚àà S is active (no state ambiguity)
‚àÄt: |{s ‚àà S : state(t) = s}| = 1
```

**Invariant I2 (Monotonic Progress):**
```
States are ordered: IDLE < ARMING < PRE_SIGNING < AWAITING_PROOF < DECAP < BROADCAST < COMPLETED
Transitions MUST be monotonically increasing (except to ABORTED)
‚àÄt‚ÇÅ < t‚ÇÇ: state(t‚ÇÅ) ‚â§ state(t‚ÇÇ) ‚à® state(t‚ÇÇ) = ABORTED
```

**Invariant I3 (Timeout Enforcement):**
```
For each state s with timeout T_s:
  If (current_time - t_enter_s) > T_s AND state = s:
    MUST eventually transition to ABORTED
‚àÄs ‚àà {ARMING, PRE_SIGNING, AWAITING_PROOF, DECAP, BROADCAST}:
  elapsed_time(s) > T_s ‚üπ ‚óá(state = ABORTED)
```
(Using temporal logic ‚óá = "eventually")

**Invariant I4 (Abort Finality):**
```
Once state = ABORTED, no further transitions allowed (terminal state)
state = ABORTED ‚üπ ‚ñ°(state = ABORTED)
```
(Using temporal logic ‚ñ° = "always")

Implementations MUST include runtime assertions checking these invariants and fail-fast (abort with error) if any invariant is violated.

#### 12.2.6 Upgrade to MUST: CSV Abort Path

The optional Timeout/Abort path (¬ß2, lines 36-39) is upgraded from SHOULD to MUST:

**Original (¬ß2):**
```
Timeout/Abort (optional) :
    <Œî> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP
    <P_abort> OP_CHECKSIG
```

**Revised (MUST):**
```
Timeout/Abort (REQUIRED) :
    <Œî> OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP
    <P_abort> OP_CHECKSIG
```

**Rationale:** Without an abort path, funds can be locked indefinitely if proof generation fails. The abort path is a critical liveness guarantee and MUST be included.

**Œî Specification:**
- MUST be set to Œî ‚â• 48 hours (represented as block height or time per BIP-112/113)
- SHOULD account for worst-case proof generation time plus network latency
- MAY be configurable per deployment context but MUST be disclosed in ctx_core
```

#### Recommendation 3: Add ¬ß12.3 - Front-Running Mitigation Strategies (SHOULD)

**Add to PVUGC-2025-10-20.md ¬ß1 Introduction after ¬ß12.2:**

```markdown
### 12.3 Front-Running Mitigation Strategies (Informative)

While the protocol uses SIGHASH_ALL to bind signatures to exact transaction outputs, minimizing malleability, residual front-running risks exist due to mempool observation and fee manipulation. This section provides guidance on mitigation strategies.

#### 12.3.1 Risk Analysis

**Residual Front-Running Vectors:**

**1. CPFP Anchor Manipulation:**

The spec includes a "small P2TR CPFP hook output" (¬ß2, line 50) for fee bumping. Depending on spending conditions:

**Scenario A: Anchor controlled by signing key P**
- Adversary **cannot** spend anchor (requires signature from P)
- CPFP is **NOT an attack vector**
- Fee manipulation requires consent of key holders
- **Recommended:** This is the preferred configuration

**Scenario B: Anchor is "anyone-can-spend" (e.g., OP_TRUE scriptPubKey)**
- Adversary **CAN** spend anchor in child transaction
- **Low-fee child attack:** Adversary creates child with minimal fee, delaying parent confirmation (griefing)
- **High-fee child attack:** Adversary accelerates parent confirmation (not harmful to honest parties)

**Analysis of CPFP Attacks:**
- **High-fee CPFP:** Even if adversary accelerates parent, outputs are fixed by SIGHASH_ALL. Adversary gains no value, only benefits honest parties. **Not an attack.**
- **Low-fee CPFP (Griefing):** Adversary delays confirmation by creating child below minimum relay fee. Harms honest parties (denial-of-service) but does not extract value.

**Mitigation (MUST):**
```
CPFP hook output MUST be controlled by aggregate public key P
(requires signature from pre-signing participants)

This prevents adversarial CPFP griefing while preserving fee-bumping capability for participants.
```

**Alternative (if anyone-can-spend required):**
- Add minimum fee requirement to anchor spend (e.g., OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY delay)
- Monitor mempool for CPFP attempts and alert on anomalous children

**2. Mempool Monitoring:**
   - Public Bitcoin mempool allows adversaries to observe transactions before confirmation
   - Even with SIGHASH_ALL, adversaries can analyze transaction patterns, timing, and fees (information leakage)
   - **Mitigation:** Use encrypted mempools or direct miner submission

**3. Replace-By-Fee (RBF):**

BIP-125 allows replacing unconfirmed transactions with higher-fee versions (opt-in RBF flag).

**Why RBF Attack FAILS:**
```
SIGHASH_ALL commits to all transaction outputs
Modified transaction has different sighash m' ‚â† m
Signature s = s' + Œ± is valid ONLY for original sighash m
Adversary cannot produce valid signature for m' without:
- Knowledge of Œ± (witness-encrypted, unknown without proof)
- Private key for P (unknown)

Conclusion: RBF attack FAILS under SIGHASH_ALL
```

**Mitigation (Already Satisfied):**
- Transaction template MUST use SIGHASH_ALL (required by spec ¬ß2, line 49)
- RBF is **not an attack vector** given this requirement

**Additional Safety (SHOULD):**
- **Disable RBF flag** (BIP-125 opt-out): Set sequence to 0xfffffffe (signals "no RBF")
- **Monitor mempool** for RBF attempts (should not occur, but detect anomalies)

#### 12.3.2 Mitigation Strategy 1: Encrypted Mempool (RECOMMENDED)

Bitcoin Core v24+ supports encrypted mempool propagation via P2P message encryption (BIP-324).

**Implementation:**
```
1. Enable encrypted P2P: --v2transport=1 in Bitcoin Core config
2. Connect only to peers supporting BIP-324 encrypted transport
3. Broadcast transaction via encrypted channels
4. Reduces visibility to passive observers (not miners)
```

**Limitations:**
- Miners must also support encrypted transport
- Does not prevent miner-level front-running (miners see all transactions)

**Effectiveness:** Medium (reduces passive observation, not active attacks)

#### 12.3.3 Mitigation Strategy 2: Direct Miner Submission (ALTERNATIVE)

Submit transactions directly to mining pools via private channels, bypassing public mempool.

**Implementation:**
```
1. Establish relationship with mining pool(s)
2. Submit transaction via pool's private API (not broadcast to P2P network)
3. Pool includes transaction in next block without public propagation
```

**Limitations:**
- Requires trust in mining pool
- Reduces decentralization (transaction not publicly visible until confirmation)
- Mining pool could extract MEV directly

**Effectiveness:** High (eliminates mempool observation) but introduces trust assumptions

#### 12.3.4 Mitigation Strategy 3: Transaction Template Rigidity (MUST)

Ensure transaction templates have zero output flexibility.

**MUST Requirements:**
```
1. All outputs MUST be fully specified at arming time (no change addresses)
2. CPFP anchor output MUST be controlled by signing key P (requires signature)
3. No RBF flag (BIP-125 opt-out: sequence = 0xfffffffe)
4. txid_template MUST include exact fee amount (no fee estimation flexibility)
```

**Rationale:** Eliminates any wiggle room for output manipulation or fee adjustment by adversaries.

#### 12.3.5 Deployment Recommendations

Implementations SHOULD adopt the following defense-in-depth approach:

**Tier 1 (MUST):**
- Transaction template rigidity (¬ß12.3.4)
- CPFP anchor controlled by P (requires signature)
- Disable RBF flag
- SIGHASH_ALL (already required)

**Tier 2 (RECOMMENDED):**
- Encrypted mempool (¬ß12.3.2) for BIP-324 capable nodes
- Monitor mempool for competing transactions
- Alert users if front-running detected

**Tier 3 (OPTIONAL):**
- Direct miner submission for high-value transactions
- Out-of-band coordination with miners for time-sensitive deployments

#### 12.3.6 Front-Running Detection and Response

Implementations SHOULD include monitoring capabilities:

**Detection:**
```
1. Monitor mempool for transactions spending same inputs
2. Alert if multiple transactions detected within time window (e.g., 10s)
3. Log competing transaction details (fee, outputs, timing)
```

**Response:**
```
If front-running detected:
1. Do NOT engage in fee bidding war (prevents DoS escalation)
2. Alert operators/users
3. Optionally: Abort and retry with different arming set (if possible)
4. Document incident for forensic analysis
```

**Rationale:** Fee wars benefit miners at the expense of honest participants. Better to abort and retry than escalate.
```

## Status Decision

### Final Severity
**High** (upgraded from Medium)

**Justification:**
1. **Zero-Knowledge Violation:** Timing side-channel leaks 10-12 bits of witness structure per observation, enabling full witness extraction in ~11 observations. This violates the core cryptographic property of proof existence without witness revelation.
2. **Protocol-Level Vulnerability:** Deadlock attack requires only non-participation (O(1) adversarial effort), not implementation bugs. No implementation choice can prevent deadlock without timeout specification.
3. **No Workaround:** Implementers cannot fix without spec-level normative requirements (constant-time operations, state machine timeouts).

### Acceptance Criteria

**To close PVUGC-007 as RESOLVED:**

**Tier 1 (MUST - Specification):**
1. Spec amendments (¬ß12.1, ¬ß12.2, ¬ß12.3) merged into PVUGC-2025-10-20.md ¬ß1 Introduction
2. All normative MUST clauses validated by protocol designers
3. Timeout parameters reviewed and confirmed (or adjusted with rationale)
4. CSV abort path upgraded from SHOULD to MUST

**Tier 2 (MUST - Implementation):**
1. Reference implementation demonstrates constant-time execution (TOST tests pass)
2. State machine with timeouts implemented and tested (all invariants I1-I4 satisfied)
3. Cache-oblivious pairing library validated (blst or arkworks with constant_time)
4. CI/CD TOST timing tests integrated and passing

**Tier 3 (SHOULD - Deployment):**
1. Front-running mitigation strategy chosen and documented (encrypted mempool or direct miner)
2. Deployment guide published for production use
3. Security advisory published warning of timing risks in non-compliant implementations

### Intermediate Status Options

**Option A: Partially Resolved (Spec Only)**
- If Tier 1 complete but Tier 2/3 pending
- Status: "Spec Amended, Implementation Pending"
- Risk: Implementations may not comply without reference implementation and testing framework

**Option B: Resolved with Caveats**
- If Tier 1 and Tier 2 complete, Tier 3 documented
- Status: "Resolved (Deployment Guidance Informative)"
- Risk: Deployments may skip front-running mitigations or use non-constant-time libraries

**Option C: Fully Resolved**
- All tiers complete, TOST timing tests passing, deployment guidance published
- Status: "Resolved"
- Recommendation: External audit to validate timing guarantees and cache-timing resistance

### Recommended Next Steps

**Week 1-2:** Protocol design team reviews final report, refines timeout parameters and Œµ thresholds

**Week 3-4:** Draft spec amendments (¬ß12.1, ¬ß12.2, ¬ß12.3), circulate for feedback

**Week 5-8:** Implement constant-time execution and state machine in reference implementation

**Week 9-10:** Implement TOST timing test suite, validate against statistical thresholds

**Week 11-12:** Integrate into CI/CD, publish deployment guide

**Week 13+:** External audit (recommended), publish final security advisory

### Cross-Issue Dependencies

**Depends on:**
- PVUGC-004 (PoCE-B soundness): PoCE-B verification is part of constant-time requirement (Finding 5)
- PVUGC-008 (MuSig2 compartmentalization): Pre-signing phase timeout depends on MuSig2 completion (Finding 6)
- PVUGC-005 (Context binding): ctx_hash must include all timeout-relevant parameters

**Impacts:**
- All PVUGC implementations MUST comply with constant-time and timeout requirements
- Threshold/multi-party variants need timeout parameter scaling (T_ARMING may increase with k > 10)
- Retry mechanisms (if implemented) must respect timeout bounds and invariants

**Related Security Considerations:**
- PVUGC-009 (Implementation hardening): Constant-time library selection, cache-timing tests
- PVUGC-002 (DEM key-commitment): DEM constant-time requirement critical for PoCE-B soundness

## Appendix A: Attack Complexity Summary

| **Attack** | **Adversarial Cost** | **Success Probability** | **Mitigation Cost** | **Residual Risk** |
|------------|---------------------|------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Timing Oracle (Finding 2)** | O(n_cal ¬∑ 96 pairings) where n_cal = 100 calibration samples | P(leak) ‚âà 10-12 bits per observation; full witness in ~11 observations | O(96 pairings always) + constant-time library | Negligible if Œµ < 2^(-40) |
| **Cache-Timing (Finding 2)** | O(10‚Å∂ Flush+Reload samples) | P(leak) depends on library implementation | Cache-oblivious library + testing | Negligible with blst/arkworks constant_time |
| **Arming Deadlock (Finding 3)** | O(1) - simply don't publish | P(success) = 1 without timeout | O(1) - add T_ARMING timeout | Zero if timeout enforced |
| **Mempool Front-Run (Finding 4)** | O(1) - mempool monitoring | P(success) ‚âà 0 (SIGHASH_ALL prevents) | SIGHASH_ALL (already required) | Zero given spec requirements |
| **CPFP Griefing (Finding 4)** | O(1) - publish low-fee child | P(success) = 1 if anchor anyone-can-spend | Anchor controlled by P | Zero if anchor requires signature |
| **RBF Attack (Finding 4)** | O(1) - attempt replacement | P(success) = 0 (no valid signature) | SIGHASH_ALL (already required) | Zero (attack fails) |
| **Simultaneous Timeout (Finding 3)** | O(k) - coordinate k participants | P(success) < 1/k with tie-breaking | O(1) - deterministic ordering | Negligible with grace period |
| **Key-Grinding (Finding 3)** | O(2^20 key generations) | P(success) ‚âà 2^(-233) for k=5 | O(1) - lexicographic ordering or context-bound | Negligible (astronomically small) |

**Key Insight:** All attacks are either:
1. **Eliminated** by constant-time execution + timeouts (timing oracle, deadlock)
2. **Prevented** by SIGHASH_ALL (front-running, RBF)
3. **Negligible** due to cryptographic hardness (key-grinding: 2^-233)

## Appendix C: Formal Security Statement

**Theorem (Timing Side-Channel Mitigation):**
Let Œ† be the PVUGC protocol augmented with constant-time execution requirements (¬ß12.1). For any probabilistic polynomial-time adversary A with access to timing oracle T:

```
Adv_ZK^Œ†(A) ‚â§ Adv_ZK^Groth16(A') + Œµ_timing
```

where:
- Adv_ZK^Œ†(A) is A's advantage in distinguishing witnesses via timing
- Adv_ZK^Groth16(A') is the zero-knowledge advantage of the underlying Groth16 SNARK
- Œµ_timing ‚â§ 2^(-40) is the constant-time execution parameter

**Proof Sketch:**
1. Constant-time GS-PPE decapsulation ensures T(m‚ÇÅ, m‚ÇÇ) distributions are Œµ-indistinguishable
2. TOST statistical testing validates Œµ ‚â§ 2^(-40) (both one-sided tests p < 0.05)
3. Therefore, I(W; T) ‚â§ log‚ÇÇ(1/Œµ) ¬∑ P(distinguish) ‚â§ 40 ¬∑ negl(Œª) = negl(Œª)
4. Remaining ZK property relies on Groth16 zero-knowledge and GS commitment hiding
5. By composition, Œ† preserves zero-knowledge up to negligible leakage

**Theorem (Liveness Under Timeouts):**
Let Œ† be the PVUGC protocol augmented with state machine timeouts (¬ß12.2). Assume at most f < k participants are Byzantine. Then:

```
P(protocol_deadlock) < 2^(-Œª)
```

provided timeout parameters satisfy:
- T_ARMING > expected_coordination_time + (k ¬∑ network_latency)
- T_PRESIG > MuSig2_completion_time + (k ¬∑ network_latency)
- Œî_CSV > proving_time_99th_percentile

**Proof Sketch:**
1. **ARMING phase:** If ‚â• k - f honest armers publish within T_ARMING, protocol proceeds to PRE_SIGNING
2. If < k armers publish, Invariant I3 ensures timeout triggers ABORTED transition (no infinite wait)
3. **PRE_SIGNING phase:** If MuSig2 completes within T_PRESIG, protocol proceeds. Otherwise, timeout enforces ABORTED.
4. **AWAITING_PROOF phase:** If valid proof arrives within Œî_CSV, protocol proceeds. Otherwise, CSV abort path becomes valid.
5. **Invariant I4 (Abort Finality):** Once ABORTED, no further transitions (prevents resurrection attacks)
6. **Probability of deadlock:** Requires all honest parties to fail coordination within timeout windows, which is negligible under network assumptions (Byzantine agreement with timeouts)

**Corollary (DoS Resistance):**
An adversary controlling f < k participants cannot prevent protocol completion (deadlock) or force premature abortion (liveness violation) with probability > negl(Œª), provided honest majority cooperates within timeout windows.

## Conclusion

The peer review process has rigorously validated and enhanced M2's initial analysis:

**Key Contributions:**

**Round 1 (M2):** Identified zero-knowledge violation via timing leakage and deadlock vulnerability without timeouts

**Round 2 (Crypto-Reviewer):** Constructed concrete attack algorithms, formalized state machine, proposed spec-ready normative text

**Round 3 (M2):** Identified critical gaps (TOST vs Welch's t-test, missing invariants, cache-timing, worst-case analysis)

**Round 4 (This Document):** Incorporated all revisions, achieving:
- **Mathematical rigor:** Corrected arithmetic (4560 pairs), worst-case leakage (H=0 for m‚ÇÅ=m‚ÇÇ=1), timing precision (Œºs-level)
- **Statistical correctness:** TOST methodology for constant-time validation (both one-sided p < 0.05)
- **Completeness:** State machine invariants I1-I4, cache-timing analysis, CPFP/RBF detailed analysis
- **Practical guidance:** Concrete Python test code, CI/CD integration, library recommendations

**Final Assessment:**

The timing side-channel and race condition vulnerabilities are **real, demonstrable, and severe**:
- **Security impact:** 10-12 bits of witness leakage per observation, full extraction in ~11 observations
- **Liveness impact:** Trivial O(1) deadlock attack without timeouts
- **Severity justification:** High (violates zero-knowledge, protocol-level flaw, no workaround without spec changes)

**Remaining Work:**

**Specification:**
1. Merge ¬ß12.1, ¬ß12.2, ¬ß12.3 into PVUGC-2025-10-05.md ¬ß7 GS PPE Verification (96 pairings)
2. Upgrade CSV abort from SHOULD to MUST
3. Integrate state machine invariants I1-I4

**Implementation:**
1. Implement constant-time execution (96 pairings always, cache-oblivious library)
2. Implement state machine with timeout enforcement
3. Develop TOST timing test suite

**Testing:**
1. Validate TOST tests pass (10‚Å∂ samples, both p < 0.05)
2. Validate cache-timing resistance (Flush+Reload, Prime+Probe)
3. Validate deadlock prevention (timeout boundary conditions)

**Deployment:**
1. Select front-running mitigation (encrypted mempool or direct miner)
2. Publish security advisory and deployment guide
3. External audit (recommended)

**Recommendation:** Proceed with spec amendments and reference implementation. PVUGC-007 should remain **High Severity** and **Enhanced** (not Resolved) until all Tier 1 and Tier 2 acceptance criteria are met.
