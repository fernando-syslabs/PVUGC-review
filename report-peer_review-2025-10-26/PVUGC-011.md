## Executive Summary

- **Verdict:** Novel vulnerability requiring mitigation. Coalition of k >= 2 armers can coordinate KEM randomness shares {ρ_i} to satisfy ∏ρ_i ≡ 1 (mod r), bypassing per-share validation and enabling limited grinding attacks on coalition's own contributions plus griefing attacks on honest parties.
- **Impact:** No direct confidentiality break of α, but provides coalition with coordinated control over their combined contribution (T_coalition). Enables griefing via selective participation and protocol abortion. Breaks fairness assumption that protocol outcomes are independent of malicious coordination beyond individual randomness.
- **Changes:** N/A (novel finding discovered during peer review, not present in v1.0 or v2.0).
- **Remaining gaps:** Commit-reveal protocol requires integration into specification as new normative section. Performance impact analysis needed. Reference implementation and test vectors required.
- **Required action:**
  - **Spec:** Add §X "KEM Randomness Commitment Protocol" to [`PVUGC-2025-10-20.md §1 Introduction`](../PVUGC-2025-10-20.md)
  - **Implementation:** Commit-reveal scheme with 256-bit salts
  - **Testing:** Grinding attack demonstration, commitment verification tests, performance benchmarks

## Spec Location

- **Secondary:** [`PVUGC-2025-10-20.md:223`](../PVUGC-2025-10-20.md) (PoCE-A, per-share ρ_i ≠ 0 check)
- **Gap:** No aggregate randomness validation or commitment mechanism

## History (v1.0 → v2.0 → Peer Review)

### v1.0 Original State
- **Not identified:** This vulnerability was not present in preliminary-peer_review-report.md or any v1.0 analysis.
- **Per-share checks only:** Specification included ρ_i ≠ 0 validation in PoCE-A (line 224: "ρ_i≠ 0 (via auxiliary ρ_i·u_i=1)").
- **Implicit assumption:** Protocol assumed independent, uniform random selection of ρ_i by each armer.

### v2.0 Mitigation
- **N/A:** Issue not identified in v2.0 specification updates.

### Peer Review (This Report)
- **Discovery (M2, Round 1, 2025-10-15):** Novel vulnerability identified during systematic review of KEM randomness space.
- **Key insight:** Per-share validation (ρ_i ≠ 0) is necessary but insufficient. Coalition can choose ρ_i values satisfying individual checks while enforcing multiplicative relationship ∏ρ_i ≡ 1 (mod r).
- **Validation (Crypto-Reviewer, Round 2):**
  - Validated M2's discovery through formal algebraic analysis
  - Constructed concrete grinding attack scenarios with complexity analysis
  - Expanded mitigation specification with security proof and performance analysis
  - Provided test vectors and validation criteria
- **Refinement (M2, Round 3):**
  - Corrected attack scenario to reflect ceremony ordering constraints
  - Clarified that grinding limited to coalition's own contributions
  - Enhanced formal analysis of pre-protocol coordination limitations
  - This final report integrates all validated findings

## Findings

### 1. Formal Vulnerability Definition

**Definition (Collusive Randomness Cancellation):**

Let S_mal ⊆ {1,...,k} be a coalition of k_mal ≥ 2 malicious armers. Let r be the prime order of the KEM groups (𝔾₁, 𝔾₂, 𝔾_T). The protocol exhibits **collusive randomness cancellation** if:

1. Each ρ_i for i ∈ S_mal passes individual validation (ρ_i ≠ 0 mod r)
2. The coalition can enforce a non-trivial multiplicative constraint:
   ```
   ∏_{i ∈ S_mal} ρ_i ≡ c (mod r)
   ```
   for a coalition-chosen constant c ∈ ℤ_r, while maintaining the appearance of independent random selection.

**Most powerful instance:** c = 1 (multiplicative identity), achieved via:
- Two-party: ρ₁ = x, ρ₂ = x⁻¹ for random x ∈ ℤ_r*
- Three-party: ρ₁ = x, ρ₂ = y, ρ₃ = (xy)⁻¹
- General k-party: ρ₁,...,ρ_{k-1} random, ρ_k = (∏_{i=1}^{k-1} ρ_i)⁻¹

**Validation bypass proof:**

For c = 1 and two-party coalition with ρ₁ = x, ρ₂ = x⁻¹:
- Individual checks: ρ₁ ≠ 0? YES (x random in ℤ_r*). ρ₂ ≠ 0? YES (x⁻¹ ≠ 0 since x ≠ 0).
- Aggregate: ρ₁ · ρ₂ = x · x⁻¹ ≡ 1 (mod r). ✓
- Distinguishability: Individual ρ_i values are uniformly distributed in ℤ_r* (no statistical test distinguishes from honest).
- Detection gap: Current spec has no mechanism to detect multiplicative relationships across shares.

**Claim 1 (Current spec insufficiency):** The v2.0 specification's per-share validation in PoCE-A (PVUGC-2025-10-20.md:223) does not prevent collusive randomness cancellation.

*Proof:* PoCE-A proves for each share i:
```
ρ_i ≠ 0  ∧  D₁,j = U_j^{ρ_i}  ∧  D₂,k = V_k^{ρ_i}  ∧  ...
```
This is a conjunction of per-share predicates. No term captures cross-share relationships like ∏ρ_i = 1. The proof system is share-independent by design (k-of-k arming allows asynchronous contribution). QED.

### 2. Algebraic Structure Analysis

**Question:** Why does multiplicative cancellation in {ρ_i} not directly break additivity of {s_i}?

**Answer:** Type mismatch in group operations.

- **KEM randomness:** Multiplicative group ℤ_r* under scalar multiplication, exponents for group elements.
- **Secret shares:** Additive group ℤ_n under addition (n = secp256k1 curve order ≈ 2²⁵⁶).
- **Adaptor construction:** α = ∑s_i (additive), T = ∑T_i = (∑s_i)·G (scalar multiplication by sum).
- **KEM encryption:** Each s_i encrypted independently under K_i = Poseidon2(ser(G_G16^{ρ_i}) || ...).

**Key observation:** The map ρ_i → K_i → s_i involves:
1. Exponentiation: M_i = G_G16^{ρ_i} (multiplicative in exponent)
2. Hash: K_i = H(M_i, ...) (breaks algebraic structure)
3. DEM: s_i = Dec(ct_i, K_i) (xor with keystream)

**Lemma 1 (No direct additive leakage):**
For coalition S_mal with ∏_{i ∈ S_mal} ρ_i = 1, knowledge of {ρ_i}_{i ∈ S_mal} and final α = ∑_{j=1}^k s_j does not computationally enable solving for ∑_{j ∉ S_mal} s_j, under:
- Poseidon2 modeled as random oracle
- DEM key-commitment property
- Discrete logarithm hardness in 𝔾_T

*Proof sketch:*
Coalition knows:
- Their own plaintexts: {s_i}_{i ∈ S_mal}
- Their own KEM randomness: {ρ_i}_{i ∈ S_mal}
- Public value after spend: α = ∑s_i (revealed as α = s - s' mod n)
- Constraint: ∏_{i ∈ S_mal} ρ_i = 1

Target: Compute α_honest = ∑_{i ∉ S_mal} s_i given α = α_coalition + α_honest.

Coalition can compute α_coalition = ∑_{i ∈ S_mal} s_i (they know their own shares). Then:
```
α_honest = α - α_coalition
```
But this is trivially computable POST-SPEND when α is public. The constraint ∏ρ_i = 1 provides no additional advantage here - the attack is in GRINDING, not direct cryptanalysis.

The hash H(M_i, ...) breaks any algebraic structure that might relate M_coalition = ∏_{i ∈ S_mal} G_G16^{ρ_i} = G_G16^1 = G_G16 to honest shares' keys. QED.

**Conclusion:** M2's assessment is correct - no direct confidentiality break, but attack surface lies elsewhere.

### 3. Concrete Grinding Attack Construction

**Threat Model:**
- Coalition: k_mal = 2 armers (A₁, A₂) out of k = 5 total
- Honest parties: 3 armers (H₁, H₂, H₃)
- Goal: Maximize influence over protocol outcomes via coordinated randomness
- Constraint: Cannot recompute honest parties' arming packages

**Attack Analysis:**

#### 3.1 Failed Attack Vector: Post-Arming Grinding

**Original conception (REFUTED):**
Coalition might change their s_i values after arming to grind on final signature properties.

**Why this fails:**
1. **T commitment:** Each T_i = s_i·G is published with Schnorr PoK during arming ([`PVUGC-2025-10-20.md §1 Introduction`](../PVUGC-2025-10-20.md)).
2. **PoCE-A binding:** PoCE-A proves D_{1,j} = U_j^{ρ_i} AND T_i = s_i·G from the same (ρ_i, s_i) pair (line 221).
3. **Ciphertext binding:** ct_i = Enc(s_i || h_i, K_i) with key-commitment tag τ_i.
4. **Pre-signature timing:** s' = s_presign(m, T, R) computed after all T_i published; changing T invalidates s'.

**Corrected Threat Assessment:**

The coalition CANNOT change their s_i values after arming without:
- Invalidating PoCE-A (T_i commitment mismatch)
- Invalidating PoK (T_i = s_i·G proof fails)
- Breaking DEM key-commitment (τ_i verification fails)

#### 3.2 Actual Attack Vector: Pre-Commitment Grinding

**Corrected attack scenario (validated by M2, Round 3):**

The actual attack window is BEFORE publishing commitments. However, ceremony ordering prevents adaptive attacks on honest contributions.

```
Algorithm: PRE-COMMITMENT-GRINDING
Phase 1: Grinding Loop (before commitment phase)
1. A₁ and A₂ coordinate: choose constraint ∏ρ_i = 1
2. For iteration t = 1 to 2^target_bits:
   a. A₁ chooses ρ₁^(t) ← ℤ_r*
   b. A₂ computes ρ₂^(t) = (ρ₁^(t))^{-1}
   c. Choose candidate shares: s₁^(t), s₂^(t) ← ℤ_n
   d. Compute T₁^(t) = s₁^(t)·G, T₂^(t) = s₂^(t)·G
   e. Compute T_coalition^(t) = T₁^(t) + T₂^(t)
   f. Check property P(T_coalition^(t)) (e.g., T_x has desired bits)
   g. If property satisfied: Proceed to commitment with chosen values
3. Publish commitments for selected (ρ₁, ρ₂, s₁, s₂)
4. Complete protocol

Advantage: Can grind on coalition's own contribution T_coalition
Limitation: CANNOT grind on:
  - Final T = T_coalition + T_honest (requires honest T_i unknown at grinding time)
  - Final signature s = s' + α (requires completed protocol)
  - Any property depending on honest contributions

Ceremony ordering constraint ([`PVUGC-2025-10-20.md §9 Arming Ceremony Checks`](../PVUGC-2025-10-20.md)):
  "Pre-signing cannot begin until ALL k arming packages are received"

This means:
  - Coalition cannot observe honest T_i before committing their own
  - Grinding must occur without knowledge of honest contributions
  - Coalition risk: Protocol timeout if they delay too long
```

**Updated Attack Success Condition:**

Coalition can grind ONLY on:
1. Properties of T_coalition = T₁ + T₂ (their combined adaptor share)
2. Properties of their individual ρ_i, s_i values
3. Any value computable from coalition parameters alone

Coalition CANNOT grind on:
1. Final adaptor point T = T_coalition + ∑T_honest (requires honest values)
2. Final signature s = s' + α (requires protocol completion)
3. presig_pkg_hash = H("PVUGC/PRESIG" || m || T || R || ...) (requires T and MuSig2 nonce R, both unavailable during grinding window)

**Example limited success:** Force T_coalition_x (x-coordinate of coalition's combined adaptor share) to have specific bit pattern.

**Example failed grind:** Force final signature s to have hash H(s) with prefix, because s depends on honest contributions and protocol completion.

#### 3.3 Grindable vs Non-Grindable Targets

**Grindable targets (coalition can influence):**
- T_coalition_x coordinate (coalition's combined x-coordinate)
- Properties of individual coalition ρ_i values
- Coalition's combined hash contributions (if any)

**Non-grindable targets (require honest values or protocol completion):**
- Final T = T_coalition + T_honest (requires unknown honest T_i)
- ctx_hash (computed before arming, includes instance parameters)
- presig_pkg_hash (requires final T and MuSig2 nonce R)
- Final signature s = s' + α (requires protocol completion)

### 4. Second-Order Attack Surface

While direct grinding on final protocol outputs is prevented by ceremony ordering, the vulnerability creates significant second-order risks:

**4.1 Timing Manipulation and Griefing:**
Coalition can:
- Delay arming until observing timing patterns in honest submissions
- Repeatedly abort and restart arming (griefing attack)
- Force protocol restarts until favorable conditions emerge
- Impose computational costs on honest parties who must regenerate arming packages

**Attack cost:** Essentially free for coalition (just delay/abort)
**Impact on honest parties:** Wasted computational effort (PoCE-A generation ~10-50ms), protocol liveness degradation

**4.2 Fairness Violation:**
In multi-party coordination:
- Honest parties assume random, independent T_i contribution
- Coalition's coordinated ρ_i = {x, x⁻¹} gives them correlated control over T_coalition
- Breaks fairness assumption in applications where randomness must be unbiased (e.g., leader election, random beacon)

**Impact:** Violates protocol design principle that outcomes should be independent of malicious coordination beyond individual contributions.

**4.3 Protocol Fingerprinting:**
If coalition uses specific patterns (e.g., always ρ₁·ρ₂ = 1):
- Observable via timing (both arming packages arrive simultaneously, repeatedly)
- Observable post-decapsulation if M_i values ever disclosed
- Enables protocol-level deanonymization
- Potential regulatory or adversarial targeting

**4.4 Future Protocol Extensions:**
If protocol later adds features depending on KEM randomness independence:
- Verifiable randomness extraction from ∏ρ_i
- Proofs of independent contribution
- Randomness beacons for other protocols
- Distributed entropy sources

Then collusive cancellation becomes catastrophic (breaks fundamental security assumptions of extensions).

**Severity Justification:**

- **NOT Critical:** No direct theft of funds or confidentiality break of α
- **NOT High:** Direct attack surface limited by ceremony ordering (cannot adaptively grind on final outputs)
- **Medium severity warranted because:**
  - Breaks fundamental fairness assumption (independent randomness)
  - Enables effective griefing attacks (selective participation, repeated abortion)
  - Creates technical debt for future protocol extensions
  - Violates principle of least privilege (coalition has extra coordination freedom)
  - Low-cost mitigation available (commit-reveal adds <1ms overhead)

### 5. Mitigation Specification: Commit-Reveal Protocol

M2's proposed commit-reveal scheme is the standard cryptographic solution. This section provides complete specification:

**5.1 Protocol Phases:**

```
Phase 0: Setup (before any arming)
- Fix: CRS, vk, x, ctx_core (as in current spec)
- Derive: U_j(x), V_k(x), G_G16(vk,x) (instance-only bases)

Phase 1: Commitment (NEW)
Timing: BEFORE Phase 2 (arming)
For each armer i ∈ {1,...,k}:
  1. Sample ρ_i ← ℤ_r* (uniform random, non-zero)
  2. Sample salt_i ← {0,1}²⁵⁶ (uniform random)
  3. Compute comm_i = H_bytes("PVUGC_RHO_COMMIT/v1" || ser_Fr(ρ_i) || salt_i)
     where:
       - H_bytes = SHA-256 (as in spec)
       - ser_Fr(ρ_i) = canonical 32-byte encoding of ρ_i ∈ ℤ_r
       - || = byte concatenation
  4. Publish comm_i with signature Sig_i(comm_i) [binds to armer identity]
  5. Wait until all k commitments {comm_j}_{j=1}^k published

Phase 2: Arming (Revelation) (MODIFIED from current spec)
Timing: AFTER Phase 1 complete
For each armer i:
  1. Compute D₁,j = U_j^{ρ_i}, D₂,k = V_k^{ρ_i} (as in current spec)
  2. Compute M_i = G_G16^{ρ_i}, derive K_i (as in current spec)
  3. Generate PoCE-A (unchanged - see §5.2)
  4. Publish arming package:
     {D₁,j}ⱼ, {D₂,k}_k, ct_i, τ_i, T_i, h_i, PoK, PoCE-A,
     ρ_i,        [NEW: revelation]
     salt_i,     [NEW: revelation]
     comm_i      [NEW: link to commitment]

Phase 3: Verification (NEW)
Performed by: All parties (coordinator, armers, auditors)
For each armer i:
  1. Retrieve prior commitment comm_i from Phase 1
  2. Recompute comm_i' = H_bytes("PVUGC_RHO_COMMIT/v1" || ser_Fr(ρ_i) || salt_i)
  3. Check comm_i == comm_i'
  4. If mismatch: ABORT protocol (reject arming package)
  5. If match: Proceed with existing PoCE-A, PoK verification

Phase 4: Pre-signing (unchanged)
- All arming packages verified → compute T = ∑T_i
- Run MuSig2 → s'
```

**5.2 Modified PoCE-A:**

**Recommendation:** Verify commitment in Phase 3 (outside circuit), keep PoCE-A unchanged.

**Rationale:**
- Adding SHA-256 inside PoCE-A circuit (if SNARK-based) is expensive and complex
- External verification provides equivalent security (commitment verified before accepting package)
- Maintains compatibility with existing PoCE-A implementation
- Simpler implementation and testing

**PoCE-A remains unchanged:**
```
PoCE-A Inputs (public):
  - {U_j}ⱼ, {V_k}_k, G_G16, ctx_hash, GS_instance_digest, T_i

PoCE-A Inputs (private witness):
  - ρ_i, s_i, h_i

PoCE-A Statements (unchanged from current spec):
  1. ρ_i ≠ 0
  2. D₁,j = U_j^{ρ_i} for all j
  3. D₂,k = V_k^{ρ_i} for all k
  4. T_i = s_i·G
  5. ρ_link = H_tag(ρ_i)
  6. KDF and DEM correctness
```

**5.3 Serialization:**

```
Commitment message format:
  Domain tag: "PVUGC_RHO_COMMIT/v1" (21 bytes, ASCII)
  ρ_i:        ser_Fr(ρ_i) (32 bytes, big-endian, 0-padded)
  salt_i:     salt_i (32 bytes, raw)
  Total:      21 + 32 + 32 = 85 bytes input to SHA-256

Output: comm_i (32 bytes)

Revelation format (added to arming package):
  ρ_i:    32 bytes (same encoding as in commitment)
  salt_i: 32 bytes (raw)
  comm_i: 32 bytes (link to prior commitment)

Total overhead per arming package: +96 bytes
```

**5.4 Timing and Synchronization:**

```
Commitment Phase Requirements:
- Deadline: t_commit (absolute time or block height)
- All commitments must be published before t_commit
- Late commitments rejected
- Prevents rushing (committing after seeing others' revelations)

Revelation Phase Requirements:
- Start: t_commit (after all commitments in)
- Deadline: t_reveal
- Armers reveal in any order (asynchronous)
- Each revelation verified against prior commitment immediately

Abort Conditions:
- Any commitment missing at t_commit → abort
- Any revelation mismatch → abort (reject that armer)
- Insufficient reveals by t_reveal → abort (timeout)
```

### 6. Security Analysis of Mitigation

**Theorem 1 (Commitment Binding):**
Under collision-resistance of SHA-256, the commitment scheme prevents adaptive choice of ρ_i after seeing other armers' commitments.

*Proof:*
Suppose adversary A publishes comm₁ = H("..." || ρ₁ || salt₁) in Phase 1. In Phase 2, A observes other revelations {(ρⱼ, saltⱼ)}_{j≠1}. If A wishes to reveal ρ₁' ≠ ρ₁ while satisfying ∏ρⱼ = 1, A must find salt₁' such that:
```
H("..." || ρ₁' || salt₁') = comm₁ = H("..." || ρ₁ || salt₁)
```
This is a second-preimage attack on SHA-256 (given M₁ = ("..." || ρ₁ || salt₁) and H(M₁), find M₁' ≠ M₁ with H(M₁') = H(M₁)).

Second-preimage resistance of SHA-256:
- Best known attack: 2²⁵² operations (generic)
- Adversary advantage: Adv ≤ q²/2²⁵⁶ (birthday bound for q queries)
- For q = 2⁸⁰ (generous): Adv ≤ 2⁻⁹⁶ (negligible)

Therefore, A cannot adaptively change ρ₁ after commitment. QED.

**Theorem 2 (Multiplicative Independence):**
Under commitment binding (Theorem 1), the probability that k independently committed {ρᵢ} satisfy ∏ρᵢ = 1 is 1/r (negligible).

*Proof:*
Commitments force {ρᵢ}ᵢ₌₁ᵏ to be fixed before any revelation. If each ρᵢ is chosen uniformly from ℤ_r* and independently:
```
Pr[∏ᵢ₌₁ᵏ ρᵢ = 1] = Pr[ρₖ = (∏ᵢ₌₁ᵏ⁻¹ ρᵢ)⁻¹]
                  = 1/r  (uniform distribution)
```
For BLS12-381: r ≈ 2²⁵⁵, so Pr ≈ 2⁻²⁵⁵ (negligible).

If coalition coordinates by communicating off-protocol:
- A₁ commits to ρ₁, then secretly tells A₂ what ρ₂ should be
- But A₂ must commit BEFORE seeing ρ₁ revelation
- Commitment phase forces simultaneous commitment → prevents sequential coordination

Only residual attack: A₁ and A₂ agree on (ρ₁, ρ₂) BEFORE both commit (see Corollary 2 for analysis).

QED.

**Corollary 1:** Commit-reveal prevents the adaptive grinding attacks described in §3, since coalition cannot adjust ρᵢ based on honest parties' Tⱼ values.

**Corollary 2 (Pre-Protocol Coordination):**
Even if coalition coordinates ρ_i values before the commitment phase (agreeing on ∏ρ_i = 1 off-protocol), the commit-reveal scheme prevents adaptive grinding attacks.

*Proof:*
Suppose coalition coordinates: ρ₁ = x, ρ₂ = x⁻¹ before commitments.

They can:
1. Grind on their own s_i values to influence T_coalition = T₁ + T₂
2. Commit to chosen (ρ₁, ρ₂, s₁, s₂)

They CANNOT:
1. See honest parties' T_i before committing
2. Adapt their s_i based on honest contributions
3. Grind on final T = T_coalition + T_honest (honest values unknown)
4. Grind on final signature s = s' + α (requires protocol completion)

**Advantage:** Coalition can bias their own T_coalition, but cannot adapt to honest contributions or influence final protocol outputs beyond their legitimate participation share.

**Detectability:** Pre-protocol coordination requires explicit conspiracy (higher barrier than adaptive opportunistic attacks). Observable via:
- Timing: Both commitments arrive simultaneously, repeatedly
- Pattern: Statistical analysis of revealed (ρ₁, ρ₂) pairs over multiple instances
- Behavioral: Coalition members consistently participate together

**Conclusion:** Commit-reveal reduces attack to non-adaptive, detectable bias of coalition's own contribution, with no influence on final outcomes beyond legitimate participation. This is the best achievable without trusted setup or interactive protocols. QED. ∎

**Theorem 3 (Collision Resistance Requirement):**
First-preimage resistance of H_bytes is insufficient; collision resistance is required.

*Counterexample:*
Suppose H_bytes is first-preimage resistant but not collision resistant. Adversary A finds collision:
```
H("..." || ρ₁ || salt₁) = H("..." || ρ₁' || salt₁')
```
with ρ₁ ≠ ρ₁' (and both ≠ 0). Then:
1. Commit with comm₁ = H("..." || ρ₁ || salt₁)
2. Observe other parties' revelations
3. Decide which of (ρ₁, salt₁) vs (ρ₁', salt₁') to reveal based on ∏ρⱼ calculation
4. Both revelations validate (same commitment)

This breaks binding. Therefore, collision resistance is necessary.

SHA-256 collision resistance:
- Best known attack: 2¹²⁸ operations (generic birthday)
- Stronger than needed (2⁸⁰ would suffice)
- No known practical attacks

Conclusion: SHA-256 satisfies requirements. QED.

### 7. Performance Analysis

**Overhead per armer:**

```
Phase 1 (Commitment):
- Sample ρ_i: negligible (32 bytes from CSPRNG)
- Sample salt_i: negligible (32 bytes from CSPRNG)
- Compute comm_i: 1× SHA-256 hash (~1 μs on modern CPU)
- Publish comm_i: 32 bytes + signature (~64 bytes) = 96 bytes
Total: ~1 μs compute, 96 bytes communication

Phase 2 (Revelation):
- Publish ρ_i, salt_i: 64 bytes additional data
Total: 64 bytes communication

Phase 3 (Verification per armer):
- Recompute comm_i: 1× SHA-256 hash (~1 μs)
- Compare: negligible
Total per verifier: ~1 μs compute

Aggregate overhead (k armers, m verifiers):
- Compute: k hashes (commitment) + k×m hashes (verification)
  For k=5, m=10: 5 + 50 = 55 hashes × 1μs = 55 μs (negligible)
- Communication: k × (96 + 64) = 160k bytes
  For k=5: 800 bytes (negligible)
- Latency: +1 round-trip (commitment phase before arming)
  Typical: 100ms - 1s (network dependent)
```

**Comparison to baseline:**
- Current arming: ~5-50ms (PoCE-A proof generation, pairing computations)
- Added overhead: <0.1ms (hash computations), +1 round-trip

**Overhead Summary Table:**

| Phase | Operation | Compute | Communication | Latency |
|-------|-----------|---------|---------------|---------|
| Commitment | SHA-256 hash | ~1 μs | 96 bytes | +1 RTT |
| Revelation | Inclusion in package | 0 | 64 bytes | 0 |
| Verification (per armer) | SHA-256 hash + compare | ~1 μs | 0 | 0 |
| **Total (k=5)** | **5 + 50 hashes** | **~55 μs** | **800 bytes** | **+1 RTT** |
| **Baseline (arming)** | **PoCE-A + pairings** | **~5-50 ms** | **~5-20 KB** | **existing** |
| **Relative Overhead** | **negligible** | **<0.1%** | **~5%** | **+1 round** |

**Verdict:** Computational overhead negligible (<0.1% of arming cost). Communication overhead minimal (~5% increase). Latency increase of 1 round-trip is acceptable for security gain.

### 8. Alternative Mitigations (Comparative Analysis)

**8.1 Proof-of-Knowledge (PoK) for ρ_i:**

```
Approach: Each armer provides Schnorr PoK of ρ_i for fixed generator H:
  Prove knowledge of ρ_i such that R_i = H^{ρ_i}

Analysis:
- PRO: Proves armer "knows" ρ_i (not random)
- CON: Does NOT prevent collusion (coalition can still coordinate ρ_i off-chain)
- CON: Does NOT prevent ∏ρ_i = 1 (coalition chooses ρ_i satisfying both PoK and product constraint)
- Overhead: +1 Schnorr proof per armer (~100 bytes, ~50μs verify)

Verdict: Insufficient. Proves knowledge but not independence.
```

**8.2 Verifiable Random Function (VRF):**

```
Approach: Each armer derives ρ_i = VRF_sk(ctx_hash):
  ρ_i deterministic from secret key and context
  Publicly verifiable via VRF proof

Analysis:
- PRO: Guarantees ρ_i uniqueness and unpredictability (if sk secret)
- CON: Requires each armer to have long-term secret key (key management burden)
- CON: Deterministic (no refresh across protocol instances with same ctx_hash)
- CON: Vulnerable if sk compromised
- Overhead: VRF evaluation + proof (~200 bytes, ~100μs)

Verdict: Overkill. Solves problem but adds complexity. Commit-reveal simpler.
```

**8.3 Aggregate Randomness Check:**

```
Approach: Add PoCE-A constraint: ∏ρ_i ≠ 1 (check in-circuit)

Analysis:
- PRO: Direct prevention of ∏ρ_i = 1
- CON: Requires multi-party computation to compute ∏ρ_i before any reveals
- CON: Or requires ρ_i revelations before PoCE-A (breaks current flow)
- CON: Only prevents specific value (1), not general collusion (∏ρ_i = c)
- CON: Non-zero-knowledge (reveals ∏ρ_i)

Verdict: Awkward. Breaks protocol modularity. Inferior to commit-reveal.
```

**8.4 Trusted Randomness Beacon:**

```
Approach: All armers derive ρ_i from common beacon R_beacon:
  ρ_i = H(R_beacon || i || sk_i)

Analysis:
- PRO: Guarantees independence (if beacon truly random and unpredictable)
- CON: Introduces trusted third party (beacon)
- CON: Beacon availability/liveness issue
- CON: Timing attacks (armers must commit before beacon reveals)

Verdict: Possible but introduces external dependency. Commit-reveal is self-contained.
```

**Recommendation:** Commit-reveal (§5) is optimal balance of security, simplicity, and efficiency.

### 9. Test Vectors

**Test Vector 1: Valid Commit-Reveal Flow**

```
Setup:
  Domain: "PVUGC_RHO_COMMIT/v1"
  r: 0x73eda753299d7d483339d80809a1d80553bda402fffe5bfeffffffff00000001
     (BLS12-381 Fr modulus)

Armer 1:
  ρ₁ (hex):   000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f101112131415161718191a1b1c1d1e1f
  salt₁ (hex): a0a1a2a3a4a5a6a7a8a9aaabacadaeafb0b1b2b3b4b5b6b7b8b9babbbcbdbebf

  Commitment computation:
    Input: "PVUGC_RHO_COMMIT/v1" || ρ₁ || salt₁
    Input (hex): 50565547435f52484f5f434f4d4d49542f7631

  Revelation:
    Publish: (ρ₁, salt₁, comm₁)

  Verification:
    Recompute: comm₁' = SHA256("PVUGC_RHO_COMMIT/v1" || ρ₁ || salt₁)
    Check: comm₁' == comm₁ ✓

Armer 2:
  ρ₂ (hex):   202122232425262728292a2b2c2d2e2f303132333435363738393a3b3c3d3e3f

Verification: Both commitments verify ✓
Result: Protocol continues
```

**Test Vector 2: Commitment Mismatch (Attack Attempt)**

```
Armer 3 (malicious):
  Phase 1 (Commitment):
    ρ₃ (original): 0x000...00042
    salt₃:         0xdeadbeef...
    comm₃:         SHA256("PVUGC_RHO_COMMIT/v1" || 0x42 || 0xdeadbeef...)
                 = 0xabcd1234...
    Published: comm₃ = 0xabcd1234...

  Phase 2 (Revelation - ATTACK):
    Observes: ∏_{i=1,2} ρᵢ = P (some product)
    Computes: ρ₃' = P⁻¹ (to force ∏ρᵢ = 1)
    Attempts to reveal: (ρ₃', salt₃)

  Phase 3 (Verification):
    Recompute: comm₃' = SHA256("..." || ρ₃' || salt₃)
                      ≠ 0xabcd1234... (published comm₃)
    Result: MISMATCH → ABORT

Outcome: Attack detected and prevented ✓
```

**Test Vector 3: Collusive Cancellation WITHOUT Mitigation**

```
Scenario: Two colluding armers without commit-reveal

[Coordination method: A₁ and A₂ coordinate off-protocol before arming.
 They agree on ρ₁ = x and ρ₂ = x⁻¹ for chosen random x, ensuring ∏ρᵢ = 1.
 This pre-protocol coordination allows them to pass per-share validation
 while maintaining multiplicative cancellation property.]

Armer A₁:
  ρ₁ = 0x0000...0123456789abcdef (agreed value)
  Publishes: Arming package with ρ₁

Armer A₂ (colluding):
  Computes: ρ₂ = ρ₁⁻¹ mod r (agreed before protocol)
  Publishes: Arming with ρ₂

Validation:
  ρ₁ ≠ 0? ✓ (passes)
  ρ₂ ≠ 0? ✓ (passes)
  ∏ρᵢ = ρ₁ · ρ₂ = 1? YES (collusion succeeds)
  Current spec: NO CHECK for aggregate ✗

Outcome: Vulnerability exploited (without mitigation)
Note: Coalition coordinated before commitment phase would begin
```

**Test Vector 4: Collusive Cancellation WITH Mitigation**

```
Same scenario with commit-reveal:

Phase 1:
  A₁ commits: comm₁ = H("..." || ρ₁ || salt₁)
  A₂ commits: comm₂ = H("..." || ρ₂ || salt₂)
  [Both commitments published BEFORE seeing any revelations]
  [Even if pre-coordinated on ρ₁, ρ₂ values, they cannot adapt after seeing honest values]

Phase 2:
  A₁ reveals: (ρ₁, salt₁)
  A₂ reveals: (ρ₂, salt₂)
  [If they try to change values: comm verification fails]

Phase 3:
  Verify A₁: comm₁ ?= H("..." || ρ₁ || salt₁) ✓
  Verify A₂: comm₂ ?= H("..." || ρ₂ || salt₂) ✓

  Result: Commitments verify, but coalition CANNOT adapt to honest values

  Impact: Coalition can only bias their own T_coalition, not final outputs
  Attack reduction: No adaptive grinding on honest contributions

Outcome: Attack surface reduced to non-adaptive coordination ✓
         Coalition cannot grind on final T or signature s
```

### 10. Implementation Guidance

**10.1 Commitment Phase Integration:**

```rust
// Pseudocode for reference implementation

struct CommitmentPhase {
    domain_tag: &'static str = "PVUGC_RHO_COMMIT/v1",
    commitments: HashMap<ArmerID, Commitment>,
    deadline: Timestamp,
}

struct Commitment {
    comm: [u8; 32],
    signature: Signature,  // Armer's signature over comm
    timestamp: Timestamp,
}

impl CommitmentPhase {
    fn commit(&mut self, armer_id: ArmerID, rho: Fr, salt: [u8; 32])
        -> Result<Commitment, Error>
    {
        // Check timing
        if now() >= self.deadline {
            return Err(Error::CommitmentPhaseClosed);
        }

        // Serialize rho
        let rho_bytes = serialize_fr(rho);  // 32 bytes, big-endian

        // Compute commitment
        let input = [
            self.domain_tag.as_bytes(),
            &rho_bytes,
            &salt,
        ].concat();
        let comm = sha256(&input);

        // Store commitment
        let commitment = Commitment {
            comm,
            signature: sign(armer_id, comm),
            timestamp: now(),
        };
        self.commitments.insert(armer_id, commitment);

        Ok(commitment)
    }

    fn verify_all_committed(&self, expected_armers: &[ArmerID])
        -> Result<(), Error>
    {
        for armer_id in expected_armers {
            if !self.commitments.contains_key(armer_id) {
                return Err(Error::MissingCommitment(*armer_id));
            }
        }
        Ok(())
    }
}

struct RevelationPhase {
    commitments: HashMap<ArmerID, Commitment>,  // From Phase 1
    domain_tag: &'static str = "PVUGC_RHO_COMMIT/v1",
}

impl RevelationPhase {
    fn verify_revelation(&self, armer_id: ArmerID, rho: Fr, salt: [u8; 32])
        -> Result<(), Error>
    {
        // Retrieve prior commitment
        let commitment = self.commitments.get(&armer_id)
            .ok_or(Error::NoCommitmentFound)?;

        // Recompute commitment
        let rho_bytes = serialize_fr(rho);
        let input = [
            self.domain_tag.as_bytes(),
            &rho_bytes,
            &salt,
        ].concat();
        let comm_recomputed = sha256(&input);

        // Verify match
        if comm_recomputed != commitment.comm {
            return Err(Error::CommitmentMismatch {
                armer_id,
                expected: commitment.comm,
                got: comm_recomputed,
            });
        }

        Ok(())
    }
}
```

**10.2 Integration with Existing Arming:**

```
Modified arming package structure:

ArmingPackage {
    // Existing fields
    share_index: u32,
    D1: Vec<G2>,          // {D₁,j}
    D2: Vec<G1>,          // {D₂,k}
    ct: Vec<u8>,          // Ciphertext
    tau: Vec<u8>,         // Tag
    T_i: G1,              // Adaptor share
    h_i: [u8; 32],        // Hash
    pok: SchnorrProof,
    poce_a: PoCEProof,

    // NEW fields for commit-reveal
    rho: Fr,              // Revealed KEM randomness
    salt: [u8; 32],       // Revealed salt
    commitment: [u8; 32], // Link to prior commitment (for verification)
}

fn verify_arming_package(pkg: &ArmingPackage, prior_commitment: &Commitment)
    -> Result<(), Error>
{
    // NEW: Verify commitment first
    verify_commitment_revelation(
        prior_commitment.comm,
        pkg.rho,
        pkg.salt,
    )?;

    // Existing verifications
    verify_pok(&pkg.pok, pkg.T_i)?;
    verify_poce_a(&pkg.poce_a, &pkg.D1, &pkg.D2, pkg.T_i)?;
    verify_dem(&pkg.ct, &pkg.tau)?;

    Ok(())
}
```

**10.3 Error Handling:**

```
Error types:
- CommitmentPhaseClosed: Commitment submitted after deadline
- MissingCommitment: Armer failed to commit in Phase 1
- CommitmentMismatch: Revealed (ρ, salt) doesn't match commitment
- InvalidSalt: Salt not 256 bits or non-random
- InvalidRho: ρ = 0 or ρ ∉ ℤ_r

Abort conditions:
- ANY CommitmentMismatch → abort entire protocol instance
- Missing commitments at deadline → abort (or proceed with subset)
- Invalid PoK/PoCE after revelation → reject armer (existing behavior)
```

**10.4 Coordinator Responsibilities:**

```
Coordinator checklist:
1. Announce commitment phase start and deadline t_commit
2. Collect commitments, verify signatures, store with timestamps
3. At t_commit: Check all expected armers committed
4. Announce revelation phase start
5. Collect arming packages (with revelations)
6. For each package: Verify revelation matches prior commitment
7. If any mismatch: Abort and broadcast abort signal
8. If all valid: Proceed to pre-signing
```

### 11. Cross-References and Related Issues

**Related vulnerabilities mitigated by this fix:**

- **Timing attacks:** Commit-reveal adds explicit timing structure that prevents adaptive timing manipulation
- **Griefing attacks:** Reduces effectiveness by preventing adaptive coordination based on honest values
- **Future randomness beacon protocols:** Establishes independent randomness foundation for extensions

**Specification sections affected:**

- **§6 (KEM Encapsulation):** Add commitment requirement before line 152
- **§8 (PoCE):** Document that PoCE-A doesn't verify commitment (external check in Phase 3)
- **§3 (Context binding):** Include commitment phase in ceremony ordering
- **§12 (Engineering checklist):** Add commitment verification step

**Dependencies:**

- Requires SHA-256 (already used for H_bytes in spec)
- No new cryptographic primitives
- Compatible with existing PoCE-A structure (no circuit changes - verified externally)

## Recommendations

### Normative (MUST)

1. **Commitment Protocol Specification:**
   - Add new §6.5 "KEM Randomness Commitment Protocol" to [`PVUGC-2025-10-20.md §1 Introduction`](../PVUGC-2025-10-20.md)
   - Specify three phases: Commitment → Revelation → Verification
   - Define commitment format: `comm_i = SHA256("PVUGC_RHO_COMMIT/v1" || ser_Fr(ρ_i) || salt_i)`
   - Require 256-bit uniform random salt for each armer

2. **Ceremony Ordering:**
   - Modify §5 (Distributed adaptor setup) to require commitment phase BEFORE arming
   - Specify timing: All commitments published before any revelation
   - Define abort condition: Commitment mismatch → immediate abort

3. **Arming Package Format:**
   - Extend arming package (§6 and §8) to include:
     - `rho` (32 bytes): Revealed KEM randomness
     - `salt` (32 bytes): Revealed commitment salt
     - `commitment` (32 bytes): Reference to prior commitment
   - Total overhead: +96 bytes per arming package

4. **Verification Requirements:**
   - Add verification step in §8 (PoCE verification) before PoCE-A:
     - Retrieve commitment from Phase 1
     - Recompute `comm' = SHA256("..." || rho || salt)`
     - Check `comm' == comm`
     - Reject package if mismatch
   - Verification MUST be performed by all parties (coordinator, armers, auditors)

5. **Salt Generation:**
   - MUST use cryptographically secure random number generator
   - MUST sample full 256 bits uniform random
   - MUST NOT reuse salt across protocol instances
   - SHOULD use OS-provided CSPRNG (e.g., /dev/urandom, getrandom(), BCryptGenRandom())

### Implementation/Testing

6. **Reference Implementation:**
   - Provide reference Rust/Python implementation of commitment protocol
   - Include commitment computation, revelation verification
   - Demonstrate integration with existing arming flow

7. **Test Vectors:**
   - Publish test vectors for:
     - Valid commit-reveal flow (Test Vector 1)
     - Commitment mismatch detection (Test Vector 2)
     - Collusive cancellation without mitigation (Test Vector 3)
     - Collusive cancellation prevented with mitigation (Test Vector 4)
   - Include edge cases: zero salt, non-canonical ρ encoding, timing attacks

8. **Grinding Attack Demonstration:**
   - Implement proof-of-concept showing collusive cancellation without mitigation
   - Demonstrate timing advantage in pre-commitment grinding
   - Show how commit-reveal prevents adaptive attacks on honest contributions

9. **Performance Benchmarks:**
   - Measure commit-reveal overhead:
     - Commitment computation time (SHA-256)
     - Verification time per armer
     - Communication overhead (96 bytes per armer)
     - Latency impact (+1 round-trip)
   - Compare with baseline arming cost
   - Publish results for k ∈ {2, 5, 10, 20} armers

10. **Integration Tests:**
    - Full protocol execution with commit-reveal
    - Multi-party simulation (k >= 5 armers)
    - Byzantine fault injection (commitment mismatch, late commits)
    - Timing attack resistance tests

### Deployment

11. **Backward Compatibility:**
    - This is a breaking change (protocol extension)
    - Requires coordinated upgrade (all armers must support commit-reveal)
    - Version flag: DEM_PROFILE or commitment phase marker in ctx_hash

12. **Rollout Strategy:**
    - Announce deprecation of commitment-less arming (6-month timeline)
    - Deploy in testnet first (3-month observation period)
    - Mainnet activation after validation

### Documentation

13. **Security Considerations:**
    - Document vulnerability in §11 (Security Analysis)
    - Explain why per-share checks insufficient
    - Describe attack surface (limited grinding, griefing, fairness violation, future protocol extensions)
    - Justify Medium severity rating

14. **Implementation Guide:**
    - Provide step-by-step integration guide
    - Document error handling (commitment mismatch, timeouts)
    - Specify coordinator responsibilities

  - Creates technical debt for future protocol extensions (randomness beacons, distributed entropy)
  - Violates principle of least privilege (coalition has extra coordination freedom)
  - Attack surface: Limited to biasing coalition's own contribution + griefing
  - Low-cost fix available (commit-reveal adds <0.1% overhead)

### Status: 🆕 Novel → ⚠️ Requires Mitigation

## Acknowledgments

**Discovery:** This vulnerability was originally identified by M2 (Mathematician #2) during Round 1 peer review (2025-10-15). Credit for the novel finding, formal definition, and initial mitigation proposal belongs to M2.

**Validation and Expansion (Crypto-Reviewer, Round 2):**
- Formal algebraic analysis (§1-2)
- Concrete attack construction (§3-4, initial version)
- Expanded mitigation specification with security proofs (§5-6)
- Performance analysis and alternative comparisons (§7-8)
- Test vectors and implementation guidance (§9-10)

**Refinement (M2, Round 3):**
- Critical correction to attack scenario (ceremony ordering constraints)
- Enhanced formal analysis (Corollary 2 on pre-protocol coordination)
- Clarification of grindable vs non-grindable targets
- Validation of mathematical proofs and security claims

**Collaboration:** This represents a successful instance of adversarial peer review discovering novel vulnerabilities during protocol analysis and iteratively refining the analysis through multiple rounds. The commit-reveal mitigation is a standard cryptographic technique, correctly identified by M2 as the appropriate solution.

## Appendix A: Formal Definitions

**Definition A.1 (KEM Randomness Space):**
Let r = #𝔾₁ = #𝔾₂ = #𝔾_T be the prime order of the pairing groups. The KEM randomness space is:
```
R = ℤ_r* = {ρ ∈ ℤ_r : ρ ≠ 0}
```
with |R| = r - 1 ≈ 2²⁵⁵ for BLS12-381.

**Definition A.2 (Honest Randomness Distribution):**
An honest armer samples ρ_i uniformly from R:
```
ρ_i ←$ R
```
with probability Pr[ρ_i = x] = 1/(r-1) for all x ∈ R.

**Definition A.3 (Coalition Independence Property):**
For k armers with randomness {ρᵢ}ᵢ₌₁ᵏ, define the coalition independence property:
```
∀ S ⊆ {1,...,k}, |S| ≥ 2:
  {ρᵢ}ᵢ∈S are independent ⟺
    Pr[∏ᵢ∈S ρᵢ = c] = 1/r for all c ∈ ℤ_r*
```

**Definition A.4 (Collusive Randomness Cancellation):**
A protocol exhibits collusive randomness cancellation if there exists a coalition S with |S| ≥ 2 and a non-negligible-probability strategy σ such that:
```
Pr[σ(S) outputs {ρᵢ}ᵢ∈S : ∏ᵢ∈S ρᵢ = 1 ∧ ∀i∈S: ρᵢ passes validation] > 1/r + ε
```
for non-negligible ε.

**Theorem A.1 (v2.0 Vulnerability):**
The PVUGC v2.0 specification exhibits collusive randomness cancellation.

*Proof:* Per-share validation checks only ρᵢ ≠ 0. Coalition strategy:
```
σ(S = {1,2}):
  ρ₁ ←$ ℤ_r*
  ρ₂ = ρ₁⁻¹
  Return {ρ₁, ρ₂}
```
Verification:
- ρ₁ ≠ 0? YES (uniform in ℤ_r*)
- ρ₂ ≠ 0? YES (inverse exists since ρ₁ ≠ 0)
- ∏ρᵢ = ρ₁ · ρ₂ = 1? YES (by construction)
- Success probability: 1 (deterministic given coordination)
- 1 >> 1/r + ε for all ε < 1 - 1/r ≈ 1

QED. ∎

## Appendix B: Attack Complexity Analysis

**Scenario:** Coalition grinding on their own contributions during pre-commitment phase.

**Baseline (Honest Protocol):**
```
For each grind attempt:
  1. Choose new ρᵢ
  2. Recompute Dⱼ = Uⱼ^{ρᵢ}, Dₖ = Vₖ^{ρᵢ}
  3. Recompute Mᵢ = G_G16^{ρᵢ}
  4. Derive Kᵢ, encrypt sᵢ
  5. Generate PoCE-A proof
  6. Compute Tᵢ = sᵢ·G
  7. Publish arming package

Cost per attempt:
  - Group exponentiations: O(m₁ + m₂) ≈ 30-40 (BLS12-381)
  - Pairing for Mᵢ: 1× multi-pairing (if computed via pairing)
  - Hash (KDF): 1× Poseidon2
  - DEM encryption: 1× Poseidon2
  - PoCE-A proof: O(|circuit|) ≈ 10-50ms (depends on circuit size)
  - Point addition: 1× G1 addition (Tᵢ)

Total: ~10-50ms per grind attempt (dominated by PoCE-A)
```

**With Collusive Cancellation (Pre-Commitment Grinding):**
```
Phase 1: Setup (one-time, pre-coordination)
  1. A₁ and A₂ agree: ρ₂ = ρ₁⁻¹ (ensures ∏ρᵢ = 1)

Phase 2: Grinding (before commitment)
  For each grind attempt:
    1. Choose new ρ₁^(t), compute ρ₂^(t) = (ρ₁^(t))⁻¹
    2. Choose new s₁^(t), s₂^(t)
    3. Compute T₁^(t) = s₁^(t)·G, T₂^(t) = s₂^(t)·G
    4. Compute T_coalition^(t) = T₁^(t) + T₂^(t)
    5. Check property P(T_coalition^(t))
    6. If satisfied: Break and commit to these values

  Cost per attempt:
    - Scalar multiplications: 2× secp256k1 (s₁·G, s₂·G)
    - Field inversion: 1× (ρ₁⁻¹ mod r)
    - Point additions: 1× (T₁ + T₂)
    - Property check: ~1-10μs (depends on P)

  Total: ~100-200μs per grind attempt

  Speedup over honest: 50ms / 0.15ms ≈ 300×
```

**Important Limitation:**
Coalition can only grind on T_coalition (their combined contribution), NOT on:
- Final T (requires honest T_i)
- Final signature s (requires α = ∑s_i and protocol completion)

**Residual Attack Value:**
- Limited grinding advantage on coalition's own contribution
- Primary attack: Griefing via selective participation/abortion
- Fairness violation: Correlated control over subset of protocol randomness

This analysis supports Medium severity classification: significant but constrained attack surface.

## Appendix C: Commit-Reveal Security Proof (Full Version)

**Theorem C.1 (Binding):**
Let H: {0,1}* → {0,1}²⁵⁶ be a collision-resistant hash function. The commitment scheme `Commit(ρ, salt) = H(tag || ρ || salt)` is computationally binding.

*Formal Proof:*

Assume adversary A breaks binding with non-negligible advantage. Then A can:
1. Choose ρ₁, salt₁
2. Compute comm = H(tag || ρ₁ || salt₁)
3. After seeing external information I, find ρ₂ ≠ ρ₁, salt₂ such that:
   H(tag || ρ₂ || salt₂) = comm = H(tag || ρ₁ || salt₁)

This is a collision if (ρ₁, salt₁) ≠ (ρ₂, salt₂):
```
M₁ = tag || ρ₁ || salt₁
M₂ = tag || ρ₂ || salt₂
M₁ ≠ M₂  (since ρ₁ ≠ ρ₂ or salt₁ ≠ salt₂)
H(M₁) = H(M₂)
```

By collision resistance of H:
```
Adv^bind_A ≤ Adv^coll_H
```

For SHA-256:
```
Adv^coll_SHA256 ≤ (q²/2²⁵⁷) + ε_attack
```
where q = number of hash queries, ε_attack = advantage of best known attack.

Best known attack: generic birthday with q = 2¹²⁸, giving:
```
Adv^coll ≈ 2²⁵⁶/2²⁵⁷ = 2⁻¹
```
(theoretical, requires 2¹²⁸ storage and queries - infeasible).

Practical bound with q = 2⁸⁰ queries:
```
Adv^coll ≤ 2¹⁶⁰/2²⁵⁷ ≈ 2⁻⁹⁷ (negligible)
```

Therefore: Adv^bind_A ≤ 2⁻⁹⁷ (negligible). QED. ∎

**Theorem C.2 (Hiding - Not Required but Nice-to-Have):**
The commitment scheme is computationally hiding if ρ and salt are uniform random.

*Proof:*
Given comm = H(tag || ρ || salt) with uniform ρ, salt, finding ρ requires:
- Brute force: Try all 2²⁵⁵ values of ρ (infeasible)
- Preimage attack on H: Best known is 2²⁵² operations (infeasible)

With 256-bit salt:
```
Pr[guess ρ | comm] = Pr[guess ρ] · Pr[guess salt]
                   ≤ (1/2²⁵⁵) · (1/2²⁵⁶)
                   = 2⁻⁵¹¹ (negligible)
```

Note: Hiding not strictly required for our application (ρ revealed in Phase 2), but provides defense-in-depth. QED. ∎

**Theorem C.3 (Independence Preservation):**
For k armers using commit-reveal with honest behavior:
```
H_∞({ρᵢ}ᵢ₌₁ᵏ | {commᵢ}ᵢ₌₁ᵏ) = k · log₂(r) - o(1)
```
(min-entropy preserved).

*Proof:* By Theorem C.2 (hiding), each commitment commᵢ reveals negligible information about ρᵢ. Therefore:
```
H_∞(ρᵢ | commᵢ) ≈ H_∞(ρᵢ) = log₂(r) ≈ 255 bits
```

For k independent commitments:
```
H_∞({ρᵢ} | {commᵢ}) ≈ ∑ H_∞(ρᵢ) = k · log₂(r)
```

QED. ∎
