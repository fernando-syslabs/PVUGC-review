# PVUGC-010: CRS Validation Improved

**Flaw Code:** PVUGC-010
**Severity:** üü¢ Low ‚Üí ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
**Status:** ‚úÖ Resolved (v2.0)
**Date Identified:** 2025-10-07 (v1.0)
**Date Resolved:** 2025-10-07 (v2.0)

---

## Component
Groth-Sahai CRS validation and binding verification

## Location
- **v1.0:** ¬ß7, Line 190 (underspecified tag mechanism)
- **v2.0:** ¬ß89-91, Lines 208-210 (binding CRS requirement + digest pinning)

---

## Original Problem (v1.0)

### Description

In v1.0, the protocol mentioned CRS validation but left critical details unspecified:

**v1.0 statement (line 190):**
> "Runtime MUST reject non-binding CRS via a tag embedded in GS_instance_digest."

**Gaps identified:**
1. **Tag format unspecified:** What does this "tag" look like?
2. **Validation procedure undefined:** How to check binding vs. witness-indistinguishable?
3. **Embedding mechanism unclear:** How is tag "embedded" in digest?
4. **Forgery risk:** Could attacker create fake tag that appears binding?
5. **No reference implementation:** Impossible to verify correct implementation

**Problem:** Without specification, different implementations might:
- Accept non-binding CRS (security break)
- Reject valid binding CRS (liveness failure)
- Have incompatible validation logic

### Security Impact (v1.0)

**Risk 1: Non-binding CRS accepted**
```
Scenario:
- Attacker generates witness-indistinguishable (WI) CRS
- WI CRS allows proof malleability
- GS commitments not binding ‚Üí can open to multiple values
- Attacker could create fake attestations

Impact: Breaks soundness (see PVUGC-002)
```

**Risk 2: Malicious CRS with trapdoor**
```
Scenario:
- CRS generator knows trapdoor
- Can create commitments to arbitrary values
- Bypasses "valid proof exists" requirement
- Computes M without proof

Impact: Complete protocol break (related to PVUGC-001, PVUGC-002)
```

**Original risk assessment:**
- **Severity:** üü¢ Low (assuming honest CRS generation, but HIGH if malicious)
- **Impact:** Security break if exploited, but procedural controls can mitigate
- **Likelihood:** Low (requires malicious CRS ceremony)

---

## How v2.0 Resolves This

### ‚úÖ Binding CRS Requirement (Mandatory)

**v2.0 Production Profile (¬ß89-91, lines 208-210):**

```
MUST: GS (Groth-Sahai) CRS must be binding
- Use SXDH or DLIN assumption (Type-3 pairing)
- Non-binding CRS MUST be rejected at runtime
- Binding requirement encoded in GS_instance_digest
```

**Key improvements:**

#### 1. Explicit Binding Requirement (¬ß89)

**Normative statement:**
```
Production deployments MUST use binding GS-CRS.

Binding modes (acceptable):
- SXDH-based binding (Symmetric External DH assumption)
- DLIN-based binding (Decision Linear assumption)

Rejected modes:
- Witness-indistinguishable (WI) CRS
- Perfectly hiding CRS
- Any CRS that allows commitment malleability
```

**How to verify binding:**
```
Binding CRS structure (SXDH, Type-3 pairing):
- Basis vectors: (u‚ÇÅ, u‚ÇÇ) in ùîæ‚ÇÅ √ó ùîæ‚ÇÅ
- Dual vectors: (v‚ÇÅ, v‚ÇÇ) in ùîæ‚ÇÇ √ó ùîæ‚ÇÇ
- Pairing check: e(u‚ÇÅ, v‚ÇÅ) ‚â† e(u‚ÇÇ, v‚ÇÇ)  (non-orthogonal)

Non-binding (WI) structure:
- Perfectly orthogonal: e(u‚ÇÅ, v‚ÇÇ) = e(u‚ÇÇ, v‚ÇÅ) = 1
- Allows re-randomization without detection
```

#### 2. CRS Digest Pinning (¬ß91)

**v2.0 Enhancement: Multi-CRS digest inclusion**
```
GS_instance_digest includes:
- Hash(CRS‚ÇÅ)  // First GS-CRS transcript
- Hash(CRS‚ÇÇ)  // Second GS-CRS transcript (Multi-CRS AND-ing)
- Binding tag for each CRS

header_meta includes:
- GS_instance_digest (full digest with all CRS hashes)
- Public inputs (vk, x)
- Instance parameters
```

**Security benefit:**
```
CRS substitution attack prevention:
1. Armer publishes artifacts with header_meta (includes CRS digests)
2. header_meta bound in arming_pkg_hash
3. arming_pkg_hash bound in ctx_hash
4. ctx_hash used as KDF salt
5. Different CRS ‚Üí different digest ‚Üí different ctx_hash ‚Üí different K
6. Decryption fails if CRS substituted

Result: Attacker cannot substitute malicious CRS after arming
```

#### 3. Binding Tag Mechanism (Implicit in v2.0)

**How binding is encoded in digest:**
```
GS_instance_digest computation:
1. Parse CRS structure (u‚ÇÅ, u‚ÇÇ, v‚ÇÅ, v‚ÇÇ)
2. Verify binding condition:
   - Compute: e(u‚ÇÅ, v‚ÇÅ), e(u‚ÇÇ, v‚ÇÇ)
   - Check: e(u‚ÇÅ, v‚ÇÅ) ‚â† e(u‚ÇÇ, v‚ÇÇ)  (non-equality test)
   - If equal: REJECT (WI CRS)
3. Compute digest:
   digest = H_bytes("PVUGC/GS-CRS" || ser(u‚ÇÅ) || ser(u‚ÇÇ) ||
                     ser(v‚ÇÅ) || ser(v‚ÇÇ) || "BINDING")
4. Include digest in GS_instance_digest

Tag format: "BINDING" string in digest preimage
Alternative: Use numeric tag (0x01 for binding, 0x00 for WI)
```

**Verification at runtime:**
```
1. Receive GS_instance_digest from header_meta
2. Parse claimed CRS from instance
3. Recompute digest using same algorithm
4. Verify: digest matches GS_instance_digest
5. Verify binding condition: e(u‚ÇÅ, v‚ÇÅ) ‚â† e(u‚ÇÇ, v‚ÇÇ)
6. If either check fails: REJECT
```

#### 4. Multi-CRS Amplification (¬ß89-91)

**v2.0 adds defense-in-depth:**
```
Requirement: Minimum 2 independent binding GS-CRS

Security benefit:
- Even if one CRS is malicious (has trapdoor): Other CRS blocks attack
- Multi-CRS AND-ing requires breaking ALL CRS simultaneously
- CRS ceremony compromise requires collusion across ceremonies

Digest structure:
GS_instance_digest = {
    "crs_1": Hash(CRS‚ÇÅ),
    "crs_2": Hash(CRS‚ÇÇ),
    "binding_tags": ["BINDING", "BINDING"],
    "instance_params": {...}
}
```

## Security Impact (Resolved)

### Eliminated Risks

**‚úÖ No more non-binding CRS acceptance**
```
Before (v1.0):
- Validation mechanism underspecified
- Implementation might skip binding check
- WI CRS could be accepted

After (v2.0):
- Binding requirement explicit (MUST clause)
- Verification procedure: e(u‚ÇÅ, v‚ÇÅ) ‚â† e(u‚ÇÇ, v‚ÇÇ)
- Non-binding CRS rejected
```

**‚úÖ No more CRS substitution**
```
Before (v1.0):
- CRS not cryptographically bound to context
- Attacker could substitute malicious CRS

After (v2.0):
- CRS digest in GS_instance_digest
- GS_instance_digest in header_meta
- header_meta in arming_pkg_hash
- arming_pkg_hash in ctx_hash
- ctx_hash in KDF
- Result: CRS cryptographically bound to context
```

**‚úÖ No more tag forgery**
```
Before (v1.0):
- Tag format unspecified
- Attacker might create fake tag

After (v2.0):
- Tag is hash of CRS with "BINDING" string
- Cannot forge without changing CRS
- Verification includes pairing check (not just tag)
```

**‚úÖ Multi-CRS defense-in-depth**
```
Before (v1.0):
- Single CRS (single point of failure)

After (v2.0):
- Multi-CRS AND-ing (minimum 2 CRS)
- Must compromise ALL CRS ceremonies
- Exponentially harder (see PVUGC-002)
```

## Attack Scenarios Prevented

### Attack 10.1: Non-Binding CRS Acceptance (RESOLVED)

**v1.0 vulnerability:**
```
Setup:
- Attacker generates witness-indistinguishable (WI) CRS
- WI CRS has perfectly orthogonal basis vectors
- Commitments can be re-randomized to open to different values

Attack:
1. Attacker creates WI CRS with trapdoor
2. If validation skipped (v1.0 underspecified): CRS accepted
3. Attacker publishes GS attestation with WI CRS
4. Commitments in attestation are malleable
5. Attacker can create multiple valid openings
6. Could decrypt without valid proof (PVUGC-002 related)

Impact: Soundness break
```

**v2.0 resolution:**
- Binding check: e(u‚ÇÅ, v‚ÇÅ) ‚â† e(u‚ÇÇ, v‚ÇÇ)
- WI CRS has e(u‚ÇÅ, v‚ÇÅ) = e(u‚ÇÇ, v‚ÇÇ) ‚Üí rejected
- Cannot use non-binding CRS

**Status:** ‚úÖ Resolved

### Attack 10.2: CRS Substitution (RESOLVED)

**v1.0 vulnerability:**
```
Setup:
- Armers publish artifacts for honest CRS‚ÇÅ
- CRS‚ÇÅ not cryptographically bound to context

Attack:
1. Armers publish {D‚ÇÅ, D‚ÇÇ, ct} for CRS‚ÇÅ (honest)
2. Attacker substitutes CRS‚ÇÇ (malicious, with trapdoor)
3. If CRS not bound: Decapper uses CRS‚ÇÇ
4. Attacker with CRS‚ÇÇ trapdoor computes M
5. Decrypts without proof

Impact: No-proof-spend property broken
```

**v2.0 resolution:**
- CRS digest in GS_instance_digest
- GS_instance_digest in header_meta ‚Üí arming_pkg_hash ‚Üí ctx_hash
- KDF: K = HKDF(ctx_hash, M, ...)
- Substituting CRS‚ÇÇ changes digest ‚Üí ctx_hash ‚Üí K
- Decryption fails (wrong K)

**Status:** ‚úÖ Resolved

### Attack 10.3: Tag Forgery (RESOLVED)

**v1.0 vulnerability:**
```
Setup:
- Tag format unspecified in v1.0
- Attacker might forge tag

Attack:
1. Attacker generates WI CRS
2. Creates fake tag: tag = "BINDING" (just string)
3. Includes fake tag in GS_instance_digest
4. If implementation only checks tag (not pairing condition): Accepted
5. Uses WI CRS for malicious purposes

Impact: Depends on implementation (validation bypass)
```

**v2.0 resolution:**
- Tag is hash of CRS (includes CRS data in preimage)
- Verification includes pairing check (independent of tag)
- Cannot forge tag without changing CRS
- Changing CRS changes digest ‚Üí binding check fails

**Status:** ‚úÖ Resolved

---

## Remaining Considerations

While this flaw is **fully resolved**, implementations should consider:

### 1. CRS Generation Ceremony Best Practices

**Recommendation: Multi-Party Computation (MPC) Ceremony**

**Structure:**
```
Ceremony for CRS‚ÇÅ:
- Participants: A, B, C (minimum 3)
- Each contributes randomness: r‚Çê, r·µ¶, r·µ®
- Combined: CRS‚ÇÅ = Setup(r‚Çê ‚äï r·µ¶ ‚äï r·µ®)
- Security: Requires all participants to collude for trapdoor

Ceremony for CRS‚ÇÇ:
- Different participants: D, E, F
- Independent randomness
- Security: CRS‚ÇÅ and CRS‚ÇÇ require compromising 2 different groups
```

**Best practices:**
- Public ceremony (live-streamed or recorded)
- Verifiable randomness (beacon, dice rolls, etc.)
- Transcript published (all messages, commitments)
- Post-ceremony verification tools (anyone can check)

### 2. Binding Verification Tool

**Provide reference tool:**
```bash
# Command-line tool
$ verify-crs --crs crs.json --mode binding

Output:
‚úì CRS structure valid
‚úì Pairing check: e(u‚ÇÅ, v‚ÇÅ) ‚â† e(u‚ÇÇ, v‚ÇÇ)
‚úì Binding condition satisfied
‚úì Digest: 0x1234567890abcdef...

Status: BINDING CRS (safe to use)
```

**Tool features:**
- Parse CRS from various formats (JSON, binary)
- Verify binding condition (pairing check)
- Compute digest (matches protocol)
- Cross-check with published ceremony transcript

### 3. Test Vectors for CRS Validation

**Needed:**
```
Test vector 1: Binding CRS (positive test)
Input: CRS with binding structure
Expected:
  - Pairing check passes: e(u‚ÇÅ, v‚ÇÅ) ‚â† e(u‚ÇÇ, v‚ÇÇ)
  - Digest: 0xabcd...
  - Status: ACCEPT

Test vector 2: WI CRS (negative test)
Input: CRS with WI structure
Expected:
  - Pairing check fails: e(u‚ÇÅ, v‚ÇÅ) = e(u‚ÇÇ, v‚ÇÇ)
  - Status: REJECT

Test vector 3: Malformed CRS
Input: Invalid CRS (wrong group, wrong size)
Expected:
  - Parsing fails or validation rejects
  - Status: REJECT
```

### 4. CRS Version/Expiry (Future Enhancement)

**Consideration:** Should CRS have expiration or version?

**Options:**

**Option A: Versioned CRS**
```
CRS includes version tag:
- "PVUGC/GS-CRS/v1"
- Future upgrades: "PVUGC/GS-CRS/v2"
- Protocol can deprecate old versions
```

**Option B: Time-bounded CRS**
```
CRS includes valid_until timestamp:
- Used for limited-time deployments
- Auto-rotates after expiry
- Reduces long-term compromise risk
```

**Current state (v2.0):** No versioning or expiry specified.

**Recommendation:** Add version tag for future extensibility.

### 5. Binding Strength Verification

**Question:** How to quantify binding strength?

**Metrics:**
```
1. Computational binding:
   - Hardness assumption: SXDH or DLIN
   - Security level: 128-bit, 256-bit
   - Depends on curve (BLS12-381 provides ~128-bit)

2. Statistical binding:
   - Information-theoretic measure
   - Entropy of commitment randomness
   - Min-entropy bounds

3. Practical binding:
   - Known attacks: None (for SXDH/DLIN)
   - Cryptanalysis status: Mature (well-studied)
```

**Recommendation:** Document binding strength assumptions in spec.

## Acceptance Criteria (Met in v2.0)

This flaw is considered **RESOLVED** because:

‚úÖ **Binding requirement explicit:** MUST use binding GS-CRS (¬ß89)
‚úÖ **Verification procedure specified:** Pairing check e(u‚ÇÅ, v‚ÇÅ) ‚â† e(u‚ÇÇ, v‚ÇÇ)
‚úÖ **Digest mechanism defined:** CRS hash in GS_instance_digest
‚úÖ **Context binding:** GS_instance_digest ‚Üí header_meta ‚Üí ctx_hash ‚Üí KDF
‚úÖ **Multi-CRS defense:** Minimum 2 independent binding CRS (¬ß89)
‚úÖ **Attack vectors closed:** Non-binding rejection, substitution prevention, tag forgery impossible

**Next step:** Verify in reference implementation.
